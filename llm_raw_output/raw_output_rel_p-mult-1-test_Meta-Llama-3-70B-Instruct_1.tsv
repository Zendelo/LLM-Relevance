     Given a query and several passages, you must first arrange the passages in order of relevance to the query.
     Then, provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 3 (ties allowed) with the following meanings:
         
         3 = Perfectly relevant: The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.
         2 = Highly relevant: The passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information.
         1 = Related: The passage seems related to the query but does not answer it.
         0 = Irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query
    
    Note that each passage is Irrelevant (0) by default, only change the score if you are sure about the relevance.
    First provide a brief explanation of your decision for the order of the passages, using only the passage ids, don't repeat the text in the passages.
    Then provide the relevance score for each passage in a JSON format, each passage should be on a separate line.
    The final JSON format will be like this:

doc-3: Sour Patch Kids are a type of candy that was invented in the 1970s. They are small, chewy candies with a soft and sour sugar coating. The candies are usually shaped like small humans or animals. They were originally called ""Mars Men"" but were later renamed to Sour Patch Kids.

doc-4: The sour sugar coating on Sour Patch Kids is what makes them so sour. The coating is made from a combination of citric acid and sugar. The citric acid is what gives the candies their sour taste. The sour sugar coating is what sets Sour Patch Kids apart from other types of candies.

doc-5: The original Sour Patch Kids were orange, yellow, red, green, and blue. These colors were chosen because they are bright and fun, and they appeal to kids. Over time, the company that makes Sour Patch Kids has introduced new colors and flavors, including blue raspberry, orange tangerine, and green apple.

Here is my response:

Explanation: The order of relevance is based on how directly each passage answers the query ""when did blue sour patch come out"". Passage 3 is the most relevant as it mentions the invention of Sour Patch Kids in the 1970s, but does not specifically mention the blue sour patch. Passage 4 is less relevant as it explains the sour sugar coating but does not provide information about the blue sour patch. Passage 5 is also relevant as it mentions the original colors of Sour Patch Kids, which does not include blue, but it does not provide a direct answer to the query. Passage 1 and 2 are not relevant at all as they do not mention Sour Patch Kids or the blue sour patch.
