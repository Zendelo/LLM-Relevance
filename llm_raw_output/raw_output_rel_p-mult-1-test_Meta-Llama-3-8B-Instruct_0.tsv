q49	['p5392', 'p4703', 'p8004']	"I have arranged the passages in order of relevance to the query ""how does a bounty hunter make money"". Here is the order:

    doc-1 > doc-3 > doc-2

    The reason for this order is that doc-1 directly answers the query by explaining how bounty hunters make money through monetary rewards. Doc-3 also provides relevant information about bounty hunters and their role in finding and apprehending defendants who have skipped bail. Doc-2 is less relevant as it does not directly address the query, but rather provides general information about bounty hunters and their role in the bail bond process.
