Passage 3 is most relevant as it explicitly mentions pilots flying low as a form of protest. Passage 1 is less relevant as it discusses the efficiency of flying at higher altitudes, but does not mention pilots flying low. Passage 2 is even less relevant as it appears to be a response to a question about the maximum altitude a plane can fly, but does not provide any information about pilots flying low. Passage 4 is the least relevant as it discusses a specific aircraft's flight characteristics, but does not provide any information about pilots flying low.

     The second passage (doc-1) is somewhat relevant because it talks about the capabilities of a B-1B Lancer, but it doesn't specifically mention flying low.

     The third passage (doc-2) is the least relevant because it is a duplicate of the first passage and doesn't provide any new information.

q48	['p9582', 'p9249', 'p10812']	"Explanation: The passages are ordered based on the relevance to the query about older adults gaining strength by training once per week. Passage doc-1 is irrelevant because it discusses maintaining strength and muscle with at least twice a week strength training, which is not related to the query. Passage doc-2 is highly relevant because it mentions that results are possible with just two strength-training sessions a week, which is close to the query's once-per-week requirement. Passage doc-3 is related because it discusses the recommended frequency of strength training for newbies, which is not directly related to the query but could be relevant if applied to older adults.
