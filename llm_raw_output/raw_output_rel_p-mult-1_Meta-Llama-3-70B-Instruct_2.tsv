q48	['p10319', 'p4495', 'p4314']	"Here is my evaluation:
     The order of the passages is: doc-2, doc-1, doc-3.
     The reason for this order is that doc-2 directly answers the query, providing evidence that older adults can gain strength by training once per week. Doc-1 is also related to the query, but it doesn't directly answer it, instead comparing the effects of different training frequencies. Doc-3 is less relevant, as it discusses the effectiveness of different training frequencies, but doesn't specifically address the query.

Passage doc-2 is the most relevant as it directly answers the query by comparing muscle growth in people who trained each muscle group once, twice, or three times per week. Passage doc-1 is related to the query as it discusses the correlation between the number of sets performed and the amount of muscle gained, but it does not specifically address the frequency of training. Passage doc-3 is the least relevant as it discusses deadlift training strategies and does not directly address the query.

Doc-3 is related to the query, discussing the ideal training frequency based on weekly volume, which is relevant to the query but does not directly answer it.

     The passage doc-2 is the most relevant because it provides a specific example of a strength training program for older adults, which includes training once a week at home. Although it doesn't directly answer the question, it provides relevant information about strength training for older adults.

     The passage doc-1 is somewhat relevant because it mentions strength training for older adults, but it doesn't provide specific information about training frequency.

     The passage doc-3 is completely irrelevant to the query as it appears to be a list of colleges and universities in the US, with no mention of strength training or older adults.
