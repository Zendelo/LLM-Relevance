doc-1: The treatment goals of UTI in pregnancy are to eradicate the infection with the shortest possible course of antibiotics and to maintain sterile urine for the remainder of pregnancy. Sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, and nalidixic acid are all considered safe for use in pregnancy.

doc-2: Staph bacteria are noted as coagulase negative, if they do not coagulate during coagulase enzyme test. All staphylococci causing disease in human, (except Staphylococcus aureus ), are coagulase negative and include: Staphylococcus epidermidis (by far the most common CNS) S.saprophyticus. S.lungudensis.

doc-3: However, Cipro is not a first-choice medication for this condition, due to the risk of serious side effects. Cipro should only be used for UTIs when first-choice medications cannot be used. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Bactrim is usually a first-choice antibiotic for treating UTIs.

doc-1: Medical uses. 100 mg Macrobid, Canada. Current uses include the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) and prophylaxis against UTIs in people prone to recurrent UTIs. Increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance to other commonly used agents, such as fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, has led to increased interest in using nitrofurantoin.

doc-2: S. saprophyticus causes 10–20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs). In females 17–27 years old, it is the second-most common cause of community-acquired UTIs, after Escherichia coli.

doc-3: These antibiotics are mainly antimicrobials from two specific groups — penicillins and macrolides. These include amoxicillin, azithromycin, and erythromycin. Other drugs (fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and cephalosporins) can pose health risks to a baby.

Staphylococcus Aureus Treatment, Prevention and Control. • Antibiotic resistance, especially the spread of MRSA, has complicated treatment. • MRSA isolates encode altered penicillin-binding proteins resulting in resistance to all β-lactam agents.

doc-2: Some of the antibiotics used for gram-negative bacteria are cephalosporins (ceftriaxone-cefotaxime, ceftazidime), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, amikacin), imipenem, penicillin (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

doc-3: In SBP diagnosis, broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cefotaxime) are used for most patients, until fluid cultures and sensitivity results are available. Nonetheless, controversy does exist regarding treatment duration. Studies with both ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have demonstrated effectiveness for a 5-day course; however, most clinicians continue to prefer a treatment course of 10 to 14 days. 10 Ofloxacin may be utilized as an oral alternative for patients who have not had prior quinolone exposure, vomiting, shock, encephalopathy, or serum creatinine >3 mg/dL. 10 Recent studies on recurrence rates are lacking; however, older studies suggest that the 1-year probability of a recurrent episode of SBP is as high as 69%. 16 Long-term secondary prophylaxis is recommended using norfloxacin 400 mg daily or double strength trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) daily due to the high incidence of recurrence. 10 Moreover, primary prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk patients (i.e., patients with cirrhosis and variceal/GI bleeding).

doc-1: Lower UTI Treatment. In the original IDSA guidelines from 1999, the recommended treatment for uncomplicated lower UTI in the United States was primarily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). 5 Since that time, new clinical data and a greater emphasis on the potential for antibiotics to propagate antimicrobial resistance (i.e., “collateral damage”) has led to a number of changes in the treatment recommendations within the guideline update ( TABLE 1 ). 1 In addition to TMP-SMX, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are now also considered appropriate empiric treatment options due to their reasonable efficacy and low risk for collateral damage. 1 Fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams remain alternative treatment options due to concerns for antimicrobial resistance and inferior efficacy, respectively.

doc-2: A study 11 comparing a three-day course of ciprofloxacin (Cipro) 100 mg twice daily, ofloxacin (Floxin) 200 mg twice daily, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; Bactrim, Septra) 160/800 mg twice daily, found that all three had comparable efficacy in managing uncomplicated UTI.

Sexual intercourse promotes colonization and infections are more common in the late summer to fall seasons. S saprophyticus is the second most common cause of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in sexually active young (13-40 years of age) women following E coli.

doc-1: This patient’s case demonstrates that negative urinalysis results do not necessary rule out R planticola UTI. Based on antimicrobial susceptibility results, the patient was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 500 mg/125 mg twice a day for 7 days. Antimicrobial susceptibility for Raoultella species includes gram-negative antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second- to fourth-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and tigecycline, among others.2 Although most strains of Raoultella species can be treated with antibiotics with gram-negative coverage, the documented cases of R planticola infections have demonstrated the species’ increasing resistance to antibiotics.

doc-2: Most species in the genus Raoultella are usually broadly sensitive to antibiotics based on the isolates from case series in the literature. 34 Similarly to some Klebsiella species, Raoultella spp. exhibit intrinsic resistance to ampicillin and ticarcillin which are the result of chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases. 34 – 37 Chun et al (2015) reported a series of 16 patients with isolates showing antibiotic susceptibility to cephalosporins ranging from 69% to 100%, 93% susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 88% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and 100% to meropenem, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. 4 Seng et al (2016) reported, in the largest series published, that resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, quinolones, TMP-SMX and aminoglycosides were 16%, 4%, 6%, 10 and 1% respectively. 1 No resistance to imipenem-cilastatin was reported. 1 Multidrug resistant R. ornithinolytica, with acquired antibiotic resistance genes, has nonetheless been isolated in clinical specimens.

doc-1: Bacteria. Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Staphylococcus saprophyticus are the most common etiologic agents in UTI. E. coli dominate in both outpatient and hospitalized populations and are the most extensively characterized regarding mechanisms of virulence.

doc-2: Penicillins versus monobactams. Aztreonam is the only monobactam widely available for clinical use. Of 3360 patients who received multiple doses of aztreonam, 7 (0.2%) had type 1 reactions (26c ). Reviews of the immunological studies and evidence from clinical trials have not shown cross-reactivity between aztreonam and penicillins, except for sensitization reactions in patients with cystic fibrosis.

doc-3: Miscellaneous β-lactam antibiotics. Aztreonam is termed a synthetic monobactam antibiotic because unlike other β-lactam antibiotics which are bicyclic, it is a monocyclic β-lactam antibiotic. The antibacterial activity of aztreonam results not only from inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, but in addition, aztreonam has a high affinity and preferentially binds to penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP 3) of susceptible Gram-negative bacteria.

doc-1: Gonorrhea has been developing resistance to antibiotics since the 1960s, and some strains are now resistant to penicillin, tetracylcines and fluoroquinolones like Cipro. These resistant strains can only be treated with cephalosporins but at much higher doses than previously.

doc-2: While S. saprophyticus infection is rare in males, it could affect elderly or hospitalized men. On the bright side, S. saprophyticus UTI is less likely to cause bacteremia (blood infection) and is generally susceptible to most antibiotics, including penicillin.

doc-3: Some of the antibiotics used for gram-negative bacteria are cephalosporins (ceftriaxone-cefotaxime, ceftazidime), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, amikacin), imipenem, penicillin (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

doc-1: Vegetarians have the advantage here. Due to bacterial resistance to other antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins, Cipro is more effective against many bacteria. Ciprofloxacin can be used for uncompromised low-dose UTI infections for only a few days, but this is not correct.

doc-2: Most Aeromonas strains are resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin; most are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines [ 8,67,86-91 ].

doc-3: Initially, most Staph infections were sensitive to penicillin. In the 1950s, many infections became resistant to penicillin and methicillin (a related drug developed to treat these germs). Thus, the term methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was derived. Staph that can be treated with these penicillin-related drugs (eg, amoxicillin) are called methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or MSSA.

doc-2: Coagulase Positive: Staph aureus. Always consider as true bacteremia (and not a contaminant) due to the danger of delaying treatment. Coagulase Negative: Staph epidermidis. Most common cause of catheter-related bacteremia. Most common skin contaminant found in blood cultures. Staph saprophyticus. UTIs in women.

doc-3: Methicillin-resistant staph infections can be hard to treat because there may be few effective antimicrobials available. Methicillin-resistance was more common in the coagulase negative subspecies, S. schleiferi schleiferi. It’s hard to say whether this means a lot from a clinical standpoint.

doc-1: By Chris Harnick. NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 14: Actress Penny Marshall attends the 10th Annual TV Land Awards at the Lexington Avenue Armory on April 14, 2012 in New York City. (Photo by Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images) “Laverne & Shirley” ended its eight-season run 30 years ago on May 10, 1983, but turn on your TV at the right time and you’ll still find Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams in their now-iconic roles.

doc-2: Marshall and Williams played Laverne and Shirley on “Happy Days” for the first time in November 1975. The “chaos,” Marshall recalled, was getting the two characters from “Happy Days” to their own series. Eventually “Laverne & Shirley” premiered January 27, 1976 and produced 178 episodes. “We did a lot.

doc-3: Her brother was correct, and the girls were such a hit that Laverne and Shirley became the first Happy Days spin-off, with Cindy Williams as Shirley. The ""fast girls"" were slowed down a bit for their own series. Shirley slept with her stuffed cat, while Laverne (Marshall) was a loud whiner.

doc-2: Songfacts®: This was the theme from the TV series Laverne & Shirley, starring Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams.

Williams stormed off the set and filed a $20,000,000 lawsuit against Paramount Pictures (later settled out of court).

doc-1: 5 Laverne & Shirley (1976) This sitcom, created by Marshall, ran for eight seasons and featured the characters of Laverne and Shirley, who are roommates and work in a factory together in 1950s Milwaukee. Laverne was actually played by Marshall's real-life sister, Penny Marshall.

doc-2: One of the best crossover episodes, however, is the pilot episode of Mork & Mindy, where Mork (Robin Williams) tells the story of his first visit to Earth, when he met the Fonz and went on a date with Laverne (Penny Marshall). It was a fantastic way to link the three shows without needing them to awkwardly connect in the present day, and although the Fonz made many more appearances on Laverne & Shirley, this three-part crossover is a little bit special.

doc-3: TNT Cast Biography. Rosy McEwen graduated from the Bristol Old Vic drama school in 2017. Her theatre credits include “Octavia” in Julius Caesar at the Bristol Old Vic, “Varya” in The Cherry Orchard at The Royal Exchange, the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Tamburlaine as “Zenocrate/Callapine” and Timon of Athens as “Flaminius”.

British Railways ( BR ), which from 1965 traded as British Rail, was the state-owned company that operated the national rail system rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997. It was formed from the nationalisation of the ""Big Four"" British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail, in stages between 1994 and 1997.

doc-1: History. During the early 1980s, British Rail operated several different diesel locomotives that had been categorised as Type 5, these being a relatively high-powered locomotive suited to heavy freight trains, such as the British Rail Class 56 and British Rail Class 58.

doc-2: DB Cargo UK. 60 019 (Westerleigh, 2009) Following the privatisation of British Rail, all 100 units came under the management of the English Welsh & Scottish (EWS). Reportedly, the company was not impressed by the Class 60's performance, having a generally disfavourable attitude towards all of British Rail's locomotives.

doc-3: During March 1993, the final locomotive of the class was accepted into traffic. In preparation for the privatisation of British Rail, the organisation's freight business was divided into five separate units; of these, three would operate the Class 60.

doc-2: Background. On the privatisation of British Rail 's freight operations in 1996, Wisconsin Central Transportation Systems under the control of Ed Burkhardt bought a number of the newly privatised rail freight companies: Transrail; Mainline; Loadhaul; and later Railfreight Distribution and Rail Express Systems. Controlling 93% of UK rail freight, after a public relations exercise involving the input of the general public, the company was named English Welsh & Scottish.

doc-3: The initial classification was as Class 61, then they were subsequently given the Class 66 designation in the British classification system (TOPS). In 1998 Freightliner placed an order for locomotives. They were followed by GB Railfreight, and then Direct Rail Services.

doc-2: The Best Sources of Vitamins B-6 & B-12. Vitamins B-6 and B-12 are water-soluble nutrients. Individually, these nutrients play different roles in the body, but together, they may help lower homocysteine levels in your blood – which may in turn reduce your risk of heart disease. Only a small percentage of Americans get enough B vitamins from their diet alone, so ask your doctor if you should take a B supplement.

doc-3: B Vitamins and Your Liver. Liver disease can cause vitamin B deficiencies. The B-complex family comprises eight different B vitamins. Vitamin B deficiency most often occurs in alcoholics as a result of poor diet. B-complex vitamins often affected by liver disease include B1, or thiamine; B-6; and B-12. For instance, according to a 2014 article in ""e-SPEN Journal"", poor liver function diminishes B-12 stores and metabolism.

doc-3: Arrange Origin. It is believed that ""Arirang"" originated in Jeongseon, Gangwon Province. ""Arirang"" as a term today is ambiguous in meaning, but some linguists have hypothesized that ""ari"" (아리) might have meant ""beautiful"" in ancient Korean and that ""rang"" (랑) might have been a way of referring to a ""groom."". According to a legend, the name is derived from the story of a bachelor and a maiden who fell in love while picking Camellia blossoms near the wharf at Auraji ( 아우라지) — a body of water which derives its name from the Korean word ""eoureojida"" (어우러지다) that translates to something close to ""be in harmony"" or ""to meet,"" like Auraji connects the waters of Pyeongchang and Samcheok to the Han River.

    *Documents*:

doc-1: Active Oldest Votes. 7. Frozen spinach has been boiled/blanched. You can do this if you really want it to be as much like frozen spinach as possible, but really, you can just cook it with the water left on the leaves from washing - effectively a bit more like steaming. There's no need to freeze it.

doc-2: To blanch the spinach, boil it in salted water for 2 minutes. Drain it using a big perforated spoon or a strainer. Immediately transfer drained spinach into cold water and keep for a minute. Drain excess water and transfer blanched spinach to the medium size jar of a mixer grinder.

doc-3: Step 2: Steam the spinach for two minutes. Do this in small batches. The more spinach you stuff into your steamer basket, the less the steam will have effect. Too little spinach in the pot, and your spinach will wilt so much that it will look like it has been boiled.

doc-4: Step 5: Flash freeze the spinach. Spread the spinach leaves out on small trays or in flat containers. (I like to leave mine sitting out on the trays for fifteen minutes or so to let more water evaporate.) Place trays in the freezer for 30 minutes.

(I like stirfried fresh better than frozen).Pull off the stems from the leaves. Add seasonings (garlic, green onion, ginger) to the oil in the hot pan (or use a non-stick spray first) stir for a minute or two. Add the stems from the spinach and stir for a couple of minutes until they start to get tender (the stems take longer to cook than the leaves) Then add the leaves stir a couple of times to coat the leaves with the seasoning and cover with a lid and let steam until the leaves go limp (a minute or two).Add soy sauce, sesame oil, other finishing sauces/spices and serve.I didn't like spinach growing up because usually it was frozen and/or boiled until the leaves were really soft.

doc-2: This is how I do it: Boil the leaves for 1 minute. Pour out the water and bring new water to a boil. Now boil the leaves for another full minute. Change out the water and boil for 15 minutes. The whole process looks like this: Boil 1 minute –> Change water –> Boil 1 minute –> Change water –> Boil 15 minutes.

doc-3: Boil water - Fill up your cookware halfway with water, and then bring it to the boil and let it boil for two to three minutes. Scrape off residue - scrape your pot or pan with a wooden spoon, removing as much residue as possible. Pour out the water, and let the cookware sit for a little while. Place your enameled cast iron in the warm soapy water and scrub gently with a nylon brush.

doc-2: After leaves are clean, remove stems as desired. Tear larger leaves into silver dollar-size pieces (roughly 1 to 2 inches across). Blanch spinach leaves in boiling water or steam for two minutes, followed by soaking in ice water for the same amount of time.

doc-3: This is some of the nutrients leaching out of leaves. You can save this water and freeze it for stock or cooking grains, like rice or quinoa. To keep as much nutrition in leaves as possible, steam blanch spinach leaves by placing them in a steamer basket that keeps leaves above the boiling water. Steam for two minutes.

doc-1: Tips to make best palak paneer. 1. Blanched Vs unblanched spinach: I would recommend blanching, if you have been on a low oxalate diet and do not consume spinach without blanching in any other foods like dal palak or any spinach curry. To make palak paneer, always spinach is blanched prior to making a puree.

doc-2: Stir occasionally and cook until wilted 2-3 minutes (you can also steam in a microwave, if desired). Transfer steamed spinach into a colander set in a sink and allow it to sit until it's cool to the touch. Then, grab handfuls of spinach and squeeze as much water as you can from it (as if you were packing a snowball).

doc-3: Steamed Spinach. Remove the stems from the spinach or leave on if using baby spinach. Wash the spinach and shake off excess water. Add about 2-inches of water in the bottom of a pot with the steamer insert placed on top. Add spinach to the pot, cover and boil the water until steam is formed. Work in batches if needed.

doc-1: Steamed spinach. Steaming spinach in a hot moist-heat environment allows large batches to be cooked in under 2 minutes. It requires a minimal amount of water to create steam compared to blanching. This process helps retain the bright green color while tenderizing the greens.

doc-2: Yes, fresh spinach can be substituted for frozen spinach. You will need 8 ounces (about 6 cups) of fresh leaves. Make sure to briefly cook the spinach to wilt the leaves. I recommend steaming or blanching, then chilling in an ice water bath to immediately stop the cooking process.

doc-3: Cover and let them boil for two to four minutes, depending on the size of the beans. Remove the beans from the boiling water; either lift the basket, ladling out the beans. or if you do not have more batches, pour the water and beans through a colander. Immediately dunk the beans into an ice-water bath for two to four minutes.

doc-1: 2. Blanch the spinach for 2 minutes. Quickly dunk the full batch of spinach in the water and cover the stockpot. Start watching the clock immediately, and remove it after two minutes pass. If steam-blanching the spinach, place the leaves in the steamer basket and immediately cover it with the lid.

doc-2: 3. Transfer the leaves to ice water. Scoop the spinach out of the stockpot and into a large bowl filled with ice water. Keep the spinach submerged for another two minutes in this cold water. The quick transfer should stop the cooking process and halt the loss of nutrients.

doc-3: 6. Store the spinach in your freezer. Place the bags of spinach in your freezer for long-term storage. When prepared properly, blanched, frozen spinach should remain edible for around 9 to 14 months. Thaw the frozen spinach in your refrigerator for several hours prior to use.

doc-1: Vasospasm may cause a temporary reduction in blood flow to the visual system and transient vision loss. Some patients have had ocular examinations during the transient vision loss event demonstrating the visible vasospasm on clinical exam, fundus photography, or fluorescein angiography.

doc-2: Posttraumatic transient cortical blindness is thought to result from vasospasm and transient ischemia leading to cerebral dysfunction. [ 9, 10, 11] In these cases, vision returns to normal within minutes to hours, with no permanent neurologic sequelae. Occasionally, transient vision loss is familial.

doc-3: What Causes Blackouts? Blackouts are caused by drinking too much alcohol too quickly. Alcohol interferes with the brain’s ability to form new long-term memories. As more alcohol is consumed and the blood alcohol level rises, the degree of memory loss increases.

doc-4: remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen. Sometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary drop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to the brain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel.

doc-1: If emboli become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, they may cause coughing or shortness of breath. Emboli lodged in the brain may cause symptoms of a mini-stroke, such as numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the body or sudden vision loss or double vision.

doc-2: A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a ""mini-stroke"" caused by a temporary deficiency of blood supply to the brain. It occurs suddenly, lasts a few minutes to a few hours, and is a strong warning sign of an impending stroke. Ischemia can also effect intestines, legs, feet and kidneys.

doc-3: Just because your sudden-onset double vision disappeared after a few minutes doesn’t mean that the cause can’t kill you. There are many causes of double vision (diplopia), but sudden-onset, transient double vision is a different animal and almost always points to an underlying, very serious problem. For example, this is a possible symptom of a mini stroke (TIA: transient ischemic attack).

Long-term management after an ischemic stroke (or transient ischemic attack [TIA]) boils down to reducing not just the high risk of a stroke but also the risk of other serious events due to similar underlying vascular pathology, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death. 1 Therefore, minimizing causal vascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes) and lifestyle modification (diet, exercise) are crucial, along with carotid endarterectomy for a few carefully selected patients.

doc-2: The most common cause of a blackout is called syncope, (“sin-co-pee”). Syncope describes blacking out because of a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain. Usually syncope is so-called “Reflex Syncope”. This is the cause of fainting.

doc-3: This is important to all sufferers of blackouts. Doctors and other staff may rely on a eye-witness to an attack where the seizure would appear to be due to epilepsy, but the true diagnosis is syncope. Subtle differences exist in the appearance and the circumstances of the seizure that can be of great help.

doc-1: What is Transient Monocular Blindness? Transient Monocular Blindness, also called as Amaurosis Fugax is a condition in which there is abrupt loss of vision in one of your eyes due to a temporary lack of blood supply to your retina (light sensitive layer in your eye).

doc-2: By Chris A. Knobbe, MD. Eye strokes occur when blockages (occlusions) occur in arteries or veins in the retina, causing vision loss. The severity of vision loss depends on the extent and location of the occlusion (s) and loss of blood flow. Just as strokes occur in other parts of the body because blood flow is blocked, your eye also may suffer damage when vital structures such as the retina and optic nerve are cut off from nutrients and oxygen flowing through your blood.

doc-3: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) Central retinal artery occlusion usually occurs with sudden, profound, but painless vision loss in one eye. Most people with CRAO can barely count fingers in front of their face or see light from the affected eye. The condition may be preceded by episodes of vision loss known as amaurosis fugax.

doc-1: An ocular migraine is a rare condition characterized by temporary vision loss or even temporary blindness in one eye. Ocular migraines are caused by reduced blood flow or spasms of blood vessels in the retina or behind the eye. In an ocular migraine, vision in the affected eye generally returns to normal within an hour.

doc-2: An ocular migraine, also known as an ophthalmic migraine or retinal migraine, is a painless and temporary disturbance in vision that affects either one or both eyes. Ocular migraines usually resolve, without medication, within 20 to 30 minutes from the start of the occurrence.

doc-3: TIA and Stroke are both medical conditions related to brain. TIA is an abbreviation of Transient Ischemic Attack. In this condition the brain suffer a temporary deficit in blood supply to the brain and the ischemia causes the symptoms. The brain controls the body movements, speech, vision, hearing and sensation. In TIA these may be affected.

doc-2: How Cialis Can Cause Blindness. PDE5 inhibitors, including Cialis, can decrease blood supply to the optic nerve of the eye which can lead to a condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This condition can cause either temporary or permanent vision loss in one or both eyes. Having history or existing medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or vision problems may increase the risk of NAION.

doc-3: remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen. Sometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary drop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to the brain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel.

doc-2: Causes of flashes. As the vitreous ‘gel’ within your eye shrinks, it may pull on the retina (the focusing surface at the back of your eye) and this can cause these flashes of light in your vision to occur. A retinal tear or detached retina is a serious and potentially sight-threatening condition. It’s therefore essential to seek medical attention as quickly as possible if you encounter flashes in your vision, particularly if they are accompanied by a sudden increase in floaters.

doc-1: When a retinal tear occurs, the vitreous can leak through the tear and lift the retina from the back of the eye, a condition called retinal detachment. A retinal tear, with or without detachment, commonly causes sudden flashes of light in the affected eye 3. Other possible symptoms include floaters, spots or shadows, and blurry vision or partial vision loss.

doc-2: Feeling lightheaded and dizzy can be signs of a potentially life-threatening condition, such as a heart attack, stroke, or shock (severe drop in blood pressure). Seek immediate medical care (call 911) if you experience dizziness accompanied by feelings of pain in your chest, speech problems, confusion or loss of consciousness for even a brief moment, difficulty breathing, severe abdominal pain, severe headache, uncontrolled bleeding, sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, or changes in vision.

doc-3: Carotid artery surgery also helps prevent a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA has the symptoms of a stroke — such as numbness, difficulties with speech or vision, and trouble walking — but they last for a brief time. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, symptoms of a TIA usually disappear within an hour. Like a stroke, a TIA is caused by a temporary blockage of blood to the brain.

doc-1: brain embolism: If a blood clot travels to the brain, this causes an ischemic stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack). retinal embolism: Small clots that wouldn't block a major artery can block the smaller blood vessels feeding the retina at the back of the eye.

doc-2: A mini-stroke is also known as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and occurs when there is a temporary decrease in the amount of blood flowing to the brain. Some people experience symptoms of a stroke but others do not and numerous people are unaware that they have suffered a mini-stroke.

doc-3: Giant cell arteritis can cause serious complications, including: Blindness. Diminished blood flow to your eyes can cause sudden, painless vision loss in one or, rarely, both eyes. Loss of vision is usually permanent.

    *Query*: what causes eye blackouts
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Visual symptoms occur due to a loss of blood supply to the optic nerve, or due to a loss of retinal blood supply. Both of these conditions can cause either a temporary (Amaurosis fugax) or permanent loss of vision, usually in one eye first (see Optic nerve stroke or Retinal artery occlusion .)

doc-2: Sometimes even eye movements are enough to induce a temporary loss of vision. Retinal migraine is a spasm of the artery leading into the eye which supplies the retina. This spasm can lead to a temporary black-out of vision on one side, and is fairly rare.

doc-3: In such cases, it is advisable to seek medical assistance and investigate the plausible causes related to the blackouts. One of the causes of a blackout can be problems linked to the heart such as a cardiac arrest or stroke. It may also be related to the brain.

doc-1: The retina is nourished by blood flowing through the retinal vasculature. The location and branching patterns of retinal vessels are unique to each individual. Nutrients are supplied to the retina by blood flowing through vessels known as arterioles while the blood returns back to the body in venules. Disease of the retina may alter this pattern. In addition, in several inherited conditions such as the one described here the pathways of the arterioles are unusually tortuous and fragile which may lead to hemorrhages into the retina.

doc-2: Vasospasm may cause a temporary reduction in blood flow to the visual system and transient vision loss. Some patients have had ocular examinations during the transient vision loss event demonstrating the visible vasospasm on clinical exam, fundus photography, or fluorescein angiography.

doc-3: Posttraumatic transient cortical blindness is thought to result from vasospasm and transient ischemia leading to cerebral dysfunction. [ 9, 10, 11] In these cases, vision returns to normal within minutes to hours, with no permanent neurologic sequelae. Occasionally, transient vision loss is familial.

doc-1: Background. Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) usually presents as painless loss of monocular vision. Ocular stroke commonly is caused by embolism of the retinal artery, although emboli may travel to distal branches of the retinal artery, causing loss of only a section of the visual field. Retinal artery occlusion represents an ophthalmologic emergency, and delay in treatment may result in permanent loss of vision.

doc-2: Amaurosis fugax (Latin: fugax meaning fleeting) is a temporary loss of vision in one eye caused by decreased blood flow ( ischemia) to the retina . It may also be caused by embolization from atherosclerotic plaques in the ipsilateral (same side) internal carotid artery. It is a type of transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

doc-3: In 1990, the causes of amaurosis fugax were better refined by the Amaurosis Fugax Study Group, which has defined five distinct classes of transient monocular blindness based on their supposed cause: embolic, hemodynamic, ocular, neurologic, and idiopathic (or ""no cause identified""). Concerning the pathology underlying these causes (except idiopathic ), ""some of the more frequent causes include atheromatous disease of the internal carotid or ophthalmic artery, vasospasm, optic neuropathies, giant cell arteritis, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intracranial pressure, orbital compressive disease, a steal phenomenon, and blood hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability."".

doc-2: This lack of blood flow to the brain first causes a greyout (a dimming of the vision also called brownout), followed by tunnel vision and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g-force there is a period of disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.

doc-3: Blackouts. A blackout occurs when you drink so much so fast that your body can’t break it down. The body essentially shuts down, causing you to lose consciousness and pass out, suffer from alcohol poisoning, or have a blackout. A blackout is when you can’t remember what happened or what you did while you were drunk.

doc-1: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) Central retinal artery occlusion presents with sudden, profound loss of vision. It is most frequently caused by emboli obstructing the retinal artery (e.g. stroke). Occasionally, it can be caused by vasculitis (e.g. giant cell arteritis ).

doc-2: Temporary Vasospasm. It can lead to decreased blood flow that can be a cause of amaurosis fugax. Generally, these temporary vision blindness are lasting no longer than five minutes and it is also associated with the exercise. But vasospastic do not restrict to young and healthy people.

doc-3: Transient Ischemic Attack or Stroke. A transient ischemic attack, or TIA, refers to a temporary blockage in an artery that supplies the brain 9. When the blockage supplies a visual area of the brain, sudden temporary blindness can result, most commonly involving one eye. With a TIA, no permanent brain damage occurs and vision returns once blood flow to the affected area is restored.

doc-1: Optic neuritis causes sudden cloudy vision in one eye or both eyes, and pain in the eyes. It’s often caused by multiple sclerosis. There will be visual field loss and episodes of a sudden blackout. This ocular condition requires immediate medical intervention to prevent further vision loss.

doc-2: Carotid artery surgery also helps prevent a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA has the symptoms of a stroke — such as numbness, difficulties with speech or vision, and trouble walking — but they last for a brief time. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, symptoms of a TIA usually disappear within an hour. Like a stroke, a TIA is caused by a temporary blockage of blood to the brain.

doc-3: Blurriness, loss of peripheral vision, or total loss of vision are signs of stroke when they happen without warning. This means that blood supply is not getting to the brain cells that communicate with the eyes. Again, the sooner that a stroke is addressed, the more likely vision will return. Other than a stroke - vision problems may indicate other issues such as an ocular migraine.

doc-2: Any kind of trauma to the eye can cause a loss of vision. This may include conditions such as eye stroke, in which the retina or optic nerve experiences a loss of blood flow. This typically causes temporary vision loss, but if the condition worsens or is not treated appropriately, that loss can become permanent.

doc-3: Eye strokes don't usually cause pain, but they do cause vision loss – typically in just one eye. This loss can be temporary, but can become permanent if treatment is not sought quickly. Other symptoms may include: A sudden change in vision, or a change that worsens over the course of several hours or a day or two.

    *Query*: what causes eye blackouts
    *Documents*:

doc-1: blackout. A common term for a temporary loss of vision or consciousness. This may be a harmless fainting attack or a brief period of visual loss caused by standing up suddenly. Both are due to transient shortage of blood to the brain (cerebral ischaemia). Collins Dictionary of Medicine © Robert M. Youngson 2004, 2005.

doc-2: blackout. [ blak´owt″] temporary loss of vision and momentary unconsciousness due to diminished circulation to the brain and retina. Blackout refers specifically to a condition which sometimes occurs in aviators resulting from increased acceleration, which causes a decrease in blood supply to the brain cells.

doc-3: 2. Momentary loss of consciousness, as in absence. 3. Temporary loss of vision, without alteration of consciousness, due to positive g (gravity) forces; caused by temporary decreased blood flow in the central retinal artery, and seen mostly in aviators. 4.

doc-1: transient monocular blindness. A temporary loss of vision affecting one eye. In older adults it is usually a form of transient ischemic attack, caused by carotid atherosclerosis, and is therefore a harbinger of stroke. In young adults it may be caused by migraine.

doc-2: If emboli become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, they may cause coughing or shortness of breath. Emboli lodged in the brain may cause symptoms of a mini-stroke, such as numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the body or sudden vision loss or double vision.

doc-3: remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen. Sometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary drop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to the brain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel.

doc-1: A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a ""mini-stroke"" caused by a temporary deficiency of blood supply to the brain. It occurs suddenly, lasts a few minutes to a few hours, and is a strong warning sign of an impending stroke. Ischemia can also effect intestines, legs, feet and kidneys.

doc-2: Diabetic eye degeneration can cause blurred and/or spotty vision and can lead to blindness if not properly diagnosed and treated. Stroke: Sudden blurred vision is also a symptom of strokes. Strokes impede blood flow in the brain and can cause blurry vision, double vision, or sudden loss of sight.

doc-3: Numbness or tingling in your hands or face. Seeing flashing lights and/or floating lines. Temporary blindness in your peripheral vision. Common triggers for migraine are the same as for headaches (see Headaches section above) with the added trigger of bright or flashing lights.

Wang, O.D., F.A.A.O., with South Pasadena Optometric Group in CA.says about this: “If the visual disturbances are similar to a slow dimming of vision or blacking out of vision, and it lasts for 5-10 minutes, then it is likely caused by a mini-stroke, also known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA).”. Though the visual problem, caused by a TIA, is sometimes described as dimming or fading out, it’s also possible for a TIA to specifically cause sudden blurred vision that’s only temporary (a TIA, by definition, is temporary).

doc-3: Retinal migraine. This is the back part or fundus of a human eye. The retina is a part of the fundus. Retinal migraine is thought to happen because of vasospasm of the blood vessels that supply blood to the retina, or of the ophthalmic artery which is the artery that brings blood to the eye.

Retinal migraine (also known as ophthalmic migraines, or ocular migraines) is a medical condition that affects the eyes by causing vision loss in one eye for less than 1 hour, usually for about 10–20 minutes.

doc-2: It is believed retinal migraines are caused by vasospasms of the blood vessels of the eye in the area of the retina. The retina is at the back of the inside of the eye. In medicine a spasm is a sudden constriction or tightening of muscles that is involuntary - a person does not control them they move on their own.

doc-2: The vision goes “black” or “gray” or “dim.”. Some patients describe a “curtain over the eye” effect where the vision loss seems to close in from one direction. “If there are positive symptoms like sparks and flashes and colors, that’s rarely a vascular occlusive event,” said Dr. Subramanian.

doc-3: By Chris A. Knobbe, MD. Eye strokes occur when blockages (occlusions) occur in arteries or veins in the retina, causing vision loss. The severity of vision loss depends on the extent and location of the occlusion (s) and loss of blood flow. Just as strokes occur in other parts of the body because blood flow is blocked, your eye also may suffer damage when vital structures such as the retina and optic nerve are cut off from nutrients and oxygen flowing through your blood.

doc-1: An ocular migraine is caused by reduced blood flow or spasms in blood vessels behind the retina. Visual changes from diabetes — Diabetes can cause vision changes that may include diabetic retinopathy. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels in the retina.

doc-2: Retinal artery occlusion is usually associated with sudden painless loss of vision in one eye. The area of the retina affected by the blocked vessels determines the area and extent of visual loss. The main artery supplying blood to the eye is the ophthalmic artery; when it is blocked, it produces the most damage.

doc-3: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO): Usually occurs with sudden, profound, but painless vision loss in one eye. It is often preceded by episodes of vision loss known as amaurosis fugax, lasting seconds to a couple of minutes. It is most commonly due to a clot embolus from the carotid artery in the neck or the heart that travels to the retinal artery, causing occlusion.

Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO): Occurs suddenly and is typically painless.

doc-2: The lack of blood causes your brain cells to starve for oxygen, ultimately resulting in their death. Where a stroke occurs in the brain determines what kind of damage will occur. There are several different types of stroke including ischemic stroke, where blood supply is cut off from the brain; hemorrhagic stroke, where bleeding occurs in the brain; and a transient ischemic stroke, also known as a mini-stroke, where symptoms occur for a shorter period and blood loss to the brain is temporary.

doc-3: When vision is affected, it is the result of macular edema and/or macular ischemia. Macular edema is swelling, or thickening, of the macula, a small area in the center of the retina that allows us to see fine details clearly. The swelling is caused by fluid leaking from retinal blood vessels. It is the most common cause of visual loss in diabetes.

doc-1: Ocular. Common (1% to 10%): Blurred vision (including due to disturbance of accommodation) Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Retinopathy (with changes in pigmentation, visual field defects), retinal changes (including paracentral, pericentral ring types, temporal scotomas, abnormal color vision), corneal changes (including edema, opacities), haloes, photophobia.

doc-2: Ocular. Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal vision, visual disturbance/impairment. Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Eye pain, mydriasis, periorbital edema. Rare (less than 0.1%): Diplopia, glaucoma, hyphema, lacrimal disorder, photophobia, scotoma, visual field defect. Frequency not reported: Blurred vision, unequal pupils.

doc-3: Vision loss lasts less than five minutes and is thought to be caused by a temporary spasm (vasospasm) of a blood vessel serving the eye, triggered by the release of certain chemicals into the blood. This type of vision loss is not a warning sign of stroke.

doc-1: The study authors say mini-strokes are similar in nature to ischemic strokes, which are full blown episodes provoked by a loss of blood supply, depriving an area of the brain from oxygen. Ischemic stroke effects, including blurry vision, numbness, and slurred speech, are usually present immediately after the event.

doc-2: Symptoms. Just as a stroke can occur suddenly and without warning, symptoms of a retinal vein occlusion or ‘eye stroke’ usually occur quite suddenly. A sudden loss of vision, or sudden blurring of vision, is often the first sign that many people are aware of. The severity of symptoms differs from person to person, and also depends on whether the blockage is to the central or a branch vein.

doc-3: It may also cause a number of other symptoms, such as flashes and floaters, and sudden blindness. Retinal vein occlusion: If the blood vessels that feed the retina (the focusing surface at the back of the eye) become blocked, it is known as a retinal vein occlusion. This can cause sudden blurred vision, and also sudden blindness.

doc-1: The term “blackout” refers to the loss of memory caused by a fast spike in blood alcohol level (BAC). It may also be referred to as “alcohol-induced amnesia.”. Binge drinking, which rapidly raises BAC, is what causes alcoholic blackouts.

doc-2: If the aura symptoms only occur in one eye, which are usually intense and include diminished vision or temporary blindness (lasting up to an hour)you may be experiencing a retinal migraine. Because the cause of this type of migraine is a problem with the retina itself, such as diminished blood flow, it could cause permanent blindness.

doc-2: Mini stroke symptoms: A mini stroke, or a TIA (transient ischemic attack) is caused by a short blood loss to the brain, and the signs of a mini stroke are: Numbness or tingling. Temporary loss of vision. Difficulty speaking. Weakness on one side of the body. Because the signs of a mini stroke disappear quickly – usually within 24 hours, many people do not take such an episode seriously.

doc-3: Blackouts can also be caused by a variety of drugs and other substances including: Alcohol intoxication. Medication side effects, such as the side effects of cancer treatments or seizure medications, or agents used for anesthesia. Poisons, such as cleaning chemicals or pesticides. Recreational drug use.

doc-2: For example, when a blood clot blocks the blood supply to the brain then brain activity is affected. A person may experience numbness, weakness, paralysis, loss of sensation like vision and hearing, dizziness, confusion and even less of consciousness. This is linked to all the functions of the brain. It may be momentary in a transient ischemic attack (TIA) but once the blood supply is cut off then it results in a stroke.

doc-3: Carotid artery surgery also helps prevent a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA has the symptoms of a stroke — such as numbness, difficulties with speech or vision, and trouble walking — but they last for a brief time. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, symptoms of a TIA usually disappear within an hour. Like a stroke, a TIA is caused by a temporary blockage of blood to the brain.

doc-2: Ocular sarcoidosis can cause a wide range of visual problems, such as blurred vision, floaters (small particles inside the eye that “float” in a person’s field of vision), color blindness, or even total loss of eyesight.

doc-3: The condition causes partial blindness, as it does not limit vision altogether, and can be both temporary and permanent. Example of vision with scotoma. On the other hand, it is necessary to take into account that scotoma can result in a normal situation in people, or a pathological condition. When it comes to this second case, the alteration is usually caused by an injury to the retina of the optic nerve.

doc-1: Some people experience a type of silent migraine with visual disturbance but no head pain. “Ocular migraine” also known as “retinal migraine” is often confused with “visual migraine” which is a symptom of visual changes or vision loss resulting from the aura phase of the common migraine. However, for people who experience ocular migraines, the visual changes are a little different and can be very frightening as they most often include temporary vision loss that can last up to an hour.

doc-2: This is usually characterized by blurry, dim vision, or twinkling lights called “scintillations.”. Vision loss is temporary and restores in under an hour. What causes ocular/retinal migraines? Ocular migraines occur when the blood vessels to the eyes start to constrict, or narrow.

doc-1: Answer 4. Central retinal artery occlusion is an acute blockage of the central retinal artery that results in sudden, painless loss of vision. The central retinal artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery and supplies the prelaminar optic nerve and the inner two-thirds of the retina. 2. The most common cause of CRAO is thrombus or embolus from the carotid arteries or heart, which lodges in the central retinal artery.

doc-2: Sometimes even eye movements are enough to induce a temporary loss of vision. Retinal migraine is a spasm of the artery leading into the eye which supplies the retina. This spasm can lead to a temporary black-out of vision on one side, and is fairly rare.

doc-3: Often, a person experiences no symptoms of neck artery blockage until the artery is completely blocked, resulting in a stroke, explains Healthline. The stroke or transient ischemic attack is accompanied by sudden weakness, numbness and vision problems, dizziness, severe headaches, and trouble speaking and understanding others. Once the neck artery becomes blocked, blood flow to the brain slows down, resulting in memory problems, difficulty walking, weakness and numbness in one side of the body, and difficulty swallowing, states WebMD.

    *Query*: what causes eye blackouts
    *Documents*:

doc-1: A transient ischemic attack is characterized as a brief episode of blood loss to the brain, creating symptoms such as numbness or tingling, temporary loss of vision, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of the body. Symptoms usually resolve quickly and many people do not take such an episode seriously.

doc-2: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Syncope is the temporary loss of consciousness sometimes called fainting or 'passing out'. It is a common medical problem, affecting more than 3% of people in the United States and more than 6% of those over the age of 75 years. Most often, syncope is simply the result of a drop in blood pressure resulting from normal reflexes being triggered in an inappropriate or untimely fashion (called 'vasovagal' or 'neurally-mediated cardiogenic' syncope).

doc-3: Causes And Symptoms Of Ocular Migraine. Migraine is a neurological disorder, the precise cause of which is still quite ambiguous. Migraine is linked to abnormalities of the blood vessels of the head. Ocular migraine occurs when the blood vessels suddenly constrict, thus decreasing blood supply to the eye. This causes temporary loss of vision or distortion in one eye.

doc-1: Usually in ocular migraine there is no headache as experienced in normal migraine headache. The exact cause is not known, but it is believed to occur due to spasm in the blood vessels of retina. Along with wavy line, there may be other symptoms such as sensitivity to light, blind spots, temporary loss of vision in one eye, and flashes of light. Wavy lines in vision also develop in other conditions such as choroidal rupture, pathological myopia, multifocal choroiditis and fungal infection in the interior of the eye.

doc-2: Blackout in your eye when you stand up is the most frightening experience. Many people suffer from this symptom and they should be rest assured that it is not a life threatening condition. The most common cause of such blackouts is sudden fluctuations in blood pressure. The condition is also known as postural hypo-tension, where the blood pressure suddenly falls when you stand up from sitting or sleeping position.

doc-3: Reasons For Blacking Out When Standing Up. Primarily there are two reasons for blackout when you stand up. It may be related to cardiac issue or non cardiac event. Fortunately in most cases, blackout and fainting spell is a non cardiac event.

doc-1: An ocular migraine can cause vision loss or blindness in one eye for a short time -- less than an hour. This happens before or along with a migraine headache. It's rare. Some research suggests that in many cases, the symptoms are due to other problems. Regular migraine attacks can also cause vision problems, called an aura, which can involve flashing lights and blind spots.

doc-2: Amaurosis fugax, temporary blindness due to a lack of blood flow to the eye. It can happen because of a blockage in an artery that leads to the eye. Spasms in the artery that brings blood to the retina. Giant cell arteritis, a problem that causes inflammation in blood vessels.

Lime is already not one of my favorite artificial flavors, but this lime kid is almost bland compared to the other flavors. However, I'll still eat green Sour Patch Kids because throwing away a Sour Patch Kid is such a waste. 4.

Sour Patch Kids Extreme. The classic sour-to-sweet taste has made Sour Patch Kids a favorite for candy lovers around the world.

doc-2: In this week’s throwback post, the history of the Sour Patch Kids is exactly what we’re going to unravel. The history of Sour Patch Kids is a relatively young one, just like the adorable little candies themselves. Although the candies were first introduced to U.S. markets in 1985, they were first produced in the late 1970’s in Ontario, Canada. The story goes that they were based on a product called Mars Men, which were created by Frank Galatolie in the 1970’s.

doc-3: Regardless of their shape, these “sour then sweet” candies, as the saying goes, were a huge success. Originally, Sour Patch Kids came in lemon, lime, orange, and raspberry. However, this year, a new berry flavor was added to the bunch. Guess you could say there’s a new kid on the Sour Patch block. Back in the day, these little guys were produced by M & A Candy Company, which was formed when Allan Candy Company and Malaco Licorice Company combined.

doc-1: Sour patch kids are so good because they are both sweet and sour! My personal favorite are the blue raspberry! 8 Gummy Bears. Gummy Bears are the best candy ever they are meant for all ages, if you are old and you don't have teeth you can smack on them, if you are a toddler you can break them apart and suck on them.

doc-2: It tastes so damn good. I grew up in the 80s with American favorites like Reese’s Pieces, Nerds and Sour Patch Kids. But my husband, who’s Danish, never saw the stuff. His weekend candy was sugar-coated licorice and Haribo gummies. Junk food changes as you move around the world, from masala-flavored cheese puffs to pickled daikon.

doc-3: The Northrop Corporation was formed in California in 1939 by a man named Jack Northrop. The company moved to Delaware and was reincorporated and renamed as Northrop Aircraft in 1985. In 1994, Northrop purchased Grumman Aerospace. Grumman Aerospace was a well-known company that created the Apollo Lunar Module.

doc-1: First introduced in Canada, the sour and sweet treat became a hit in America in the 1980s. Here are 10 fun facts about Sour Patch Kids candy. 1. Sour Patch Kids were originally Mars Men.

doc-2: Created by Canadian confectioner Frank Galatolie in the 1970s, the candy was designed to capitalize on the interest in space and aliens. When Jaret International, the company Galatolie worked for, introduced the candy to the United States in 1985, they changed the name to Sour Patch Kids, most likely to take advantage of the huge popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids.

doc-3: 2. Raspberry wasn't one of the original flavors. The original sour patch flavors were lemon, lime, orange, and cherry. It wasn't until 2014 that the blue raspberry joined the regular lineup. But the candy has also introduced special flavors for their Sour Patch Kids Berries, Sour Patch Kids Tropical, and Sour Patch Xploderz.

It’s unclear (to me at least) if they are different than the blue flavor in Sour Patch Berries. Regardless, these are amazing and illict emotions that not many candies do.

Although Del Monte lags behind on banana production to Dole, Del Monte’s overall production, which includes a huge variety of fruits aside from bananas, like pineapples and melons, the company handles more than 10% of the country’s total export value.

doc-3: By the way, the three big banana suppliers you’re familiar with — Chiquita, Del Monte and Dole — all have organic banana lines now. But Schueller says that organics remain just a small fraction of the U.S. banana market — possibly in part because consumers are put off by the color. And now for his tip.

doc-1: Major foreign corporations are some of the largest landowners in the country, such as the American Chiquita Land Company which owns huge tracts of agricultural land. Nonetheless, the country is not food sufficient and has to rely on food imports to meet its domestic food demands.

doc-2: The 20 th century saw the planting of only traditional crops, especially bananas and small amounts of sugar and coffee. In fact, as of 1993, the government and two banana firms (Dole Food Company and Chiquita Brands International), owned a massive 60% of the total arable land in the country.

doc-3: Although subsistence farming is prevalent, some private landowners engage in large scale farming such as Chiriqui Land Company, Dole Foods, and Del Monte Corporation. Chiriqui Company is the leading exporter of bananas in Panama.

doc-1: In the 1980s an American firearms designer, Magnum Research, contracted IMI to re-design and manufacture a Magnum caliber ( .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum and .50 AE ), semi-automatic pistol. The result was the Desert Eagle, a very powerful handgun made famous by Hollywood and first-person shooters .

doc-2: Spillane–Coonan wars. The war began when an 18-year old Coonan swore revenge against Spillane, following the Spillane-initiated kidnapping and pistol whipping of Coonan's father. In 1966, Coonan fired a machine gun at Spillane and his associates from atop a Hell's Kitchen tenement building.

doc-3: Spillane was out of the picture, and Coonan was the undisputed boss of Hell's Kitchen. It was felt that Spillane still had to die. Roy DeMeo, a Gambino crime family soldier, murdered Spillane as a favor to Coonan. Mickey Featherstone stood trial for the murder and was found not guilty.

doc-1: Shortly afterward, federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani announced a devastating RICO indictment against Coonan and others for criminal activities going back twenty years. Featherstone testified in open court for four weeks in the trial that began in September 1987 and concluded with major convictions in 1988.

doc-2: Coonan was sentenced to sixty years in prison on assorted charges. Other leading gang members were also sentenced to long prison terms, including McElroy, who was sentenced to 60 years, and Richard ""Mugsy"" Ritter, a career criminal sentenced to 40 years on loan-sharking and drug related charges.

doc-3: Characteristics. Police pistol expanded. The police pistol is a double-action .357 revolver with a swing-out cylinder similar to that of a .44 magnum revolver instead of a loading gate like the .357 magnum revolver. Though it is a double-action, it is fired by the Courier in a single-action form with the hammer being cocked back after each shot to increase accuracy.

doc-1: However, the ramp sight that came installed served quite well in testing. Ruger LCRx .357 Mag $594.99 sportsmans.com. I can hear you now: Lord, he’s going to talk about recoil. Physics dictates nothing less in a lightweight gun.

doc-2: How The 3-Inch Barrel LCRx Enhances The .357 Magnum: Longer 3-inch barrel improves the .357 Magnum's ballistics, while keeping the revolver concealable. Built with a stainless-steel frame, the LCRx still only tops out at 21 ounces. Hogue Tamer grip goes a long way in reducing the light revolver's recoil. Friction-reducing cam does much to mitigate the revolver's heavy pull in double-action.

doc-3: Get More Information On Ruger Guns. Like the .357 Magnum, the 3-inch-barreled LCRx released at the 2019 SHOT Show strikes a perfect balance. Setting the fulcrum almost exactly between concealability and performance, Ruger has created a dandy wheelgun that flirts with being a nearly faultless carry revolver; one that’s certain to keep the age-old Magnum as relevant as ever in the 21st century.

doc-1: That Extra 1.13 Inch. For some time now, Ruger has offered a .357 Magnum in both its hammerless LCR and exposed hammer LCRx lines. However, up to this point, these have featured the popular 1.87-inch barrel configuration: snubbies. It makes sense, given that when most folks go in search of a concealed-carry revolver, they generally poke around for the tersest model they can find.

doc-2: More .357 Magnum Articles: The Advantage Of The .357 Rifle. The .357 Magnum: 20th Century Handgun and Cartridge. Classic Guns: The Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum Revolver. So, if you want the full .357 Sig power, you have to be willing to pack a full-sized handgun.

doc-3: The gun is concealable, reasonably lightweight, accurate and points naturally. It has plenty of power, and there is a broad selection of ammunition. It has less recoil than the .357 Magnum and offers an extra round capacity. It is an excellent choice for a concealed carry belly gun. Specifications: Ruger LCR.

The cartridge and the Smith & Wesson revolver were both introduced in 1935, with the handgun given the same name as the cartridge.

doc-2: Availability. The .357 Magnum is simple a .38 Special cartridge that has been lengthened by 1/8 of an inch. Even with the deluge of semi-automatic pistols in recent decades, the .357 Magnum (and .38 Special) remain among the most shot handgun calibers. A fact of which ammo makers are conscious.

doc-3: Note that the Coonan compact version is .357 Magnum-only. There are currently no other rifles or carbines chambered for the .38 Special, though if you really want to shoot it in anything other than a revolver or the Coonan handgun, you can purchase a rifle chambered for the .357 Magnum.

His Model A is essentially a product of arguments with his college roommates, and the pistol and its magazine ended up being part of Dan’s master’s thesis.

doc-3: The resulting pistols hit the market in 1981, with only a couple thousand made. Dan Coonan then sold his company to Bill Davis in the late 1980s and left it altogether in 1990.

doc-3: Coonan Classic Testing. First up was the Classic, and it turned out to be a real joy to shoot. It was controllable, accurate and anything but punishing. In fact, it was a ton of fun to shoot time and time again. With its 5-inch barrel, it makes for a very controllable and accurate .357 Magnum.

doc-1: In essence this is a very controllable and accurate .357 Magnum with a 4-inch barrel. Like the Classic, the Compact’s accuracy was excellent. Every five-shot group was at or around 2 inches, even with the heavier loads. This is plenty accurate for the real world.

doc-2: Most of my time these days is spent testing rifles, so it was nice to venture back into the handgun world. Having carried concealed since the mid-1980s, practicality has always been at the forefront of my process, and the Coonan .357 Magnums are easy to use and carry.

doc-3: In fact, I depleted a large portion of my .357 Magnum supply. I used both of them on several occasions for everyday carry. In the end, if you are looking for something a bit different in a venerable caliber for concealed carry, make sure you take a close look at the Coonan Compact or even the full-sized Classic.

doc-1: Even after the American military abandoned the round, it still didn’t lose popularity and, in some circles, .45 ACP is still preferred over the Beretta and the 9mm. One of the advantages the .45 ACP has over the .357 Magnum is that it works well in high capacity pistols like Glocks, Sig Sauers, Heckler & Kochs and the like, where as the .357 is stuck in the revolver world (with the notable exceptions of guns like the Coonan and the Desert Eagle ).

doc-2: It’s like a .357 Magnum, but not really. You’ll hear descriptions of the caliber like “it offers .357 Magnum capability in an autoloader that’s not a Coonan.”. That’s partially true, if you’re talking about a .357 Magnum firing a 125 grain bullet. DoubleTap Ammunition markets 125 grain .357 Sig loads that clock 1,525 feet per second from a 4 ½ inch barrel.

doc-3: That’s about 645 foot-pounds of muzzle energy, and within .357 Magnum territory for a 125 grain projectile. The ‘not really’ part comes into play when you consider 158 grain .357 Magnum loads. DoubleTap also produces a 158 grain .357 Magnum load that achieves 1,540 feet per second from a 6-inch barrel revolver. That’s about 832 foot-pounds.

doc-1: The Coonan Classic .357 seeks to combine these two choices, and they have done a really great job of it. If you are fan of both the 1911 and the .357 Magnum, you will be pleasantly surprised with this gun. It definitely isn’t for the uninitiated, but with a proper understanding of how the gun works and why, it isn’t a gun to be afraid of as a novice shooter .

doc-2: It works really well and is also a lot of gun for the money. The Coonan Classic .357 features a linkless barrel in a 1911 frame. That means it field strips more like a modern auto-pistol than like a 1911. The barrel still comes out the front like a standard 1911, with the front barrel bushing that turns so you can slide the barrel out, but the link you have to line up when you reassemble the gun is not there.

doc-3: This is a pure recoil operated gun, like a standard 1911, and I think that Coonan stresses this because the only other .357 Mag. pistol on the market is the Desert Eagle, and that is gas operated in part, as we explained recently in our review of the .44 Mag. version of the gun. A recoil operated gun is cleaner than a gas gun, and it is subject to less maintenance.

At a circumference of just over 5 5/8ths inches, it fits my stubby fingered hand just fine.

doc-2: I was able to shoot it comfortably. Physically the gun is flawless. Coonan sells the Classic .357 for $1,249 as you see it in the pictures with black grips and fixed sights, and they offer upgrades on sights, grips, Duracoat, and extra mags above that.

doc-3: You can buy several brands of 1911 off the shelf for more money than this Coonan and they will not be this clean and tight in their manufacturing and performance.

doc-1: It also comes with a bottle of FP-10 lubricant, and a nicely made custom soft zipper case, as well as a lock and the pin to help load the magazines. “Nothing Left to Envy” is the Coonan Arms tag line, and I think it fits this gun a lot better than “not your first pistol.”.

doc-2: Side by side with just about any other 1911, there is nothing left to envy, and as long as you understand that you have to slow down and follow the directions with the Coonan Classic .357, there is no reason it couldn’t be your first pistol.

doc-3: The $1,249 list on this gun is for the black grips (or possibly the wooden ones) and standard finish, but you can also get it in black or digital camo for additional cost. This is our test gun. It came with an extra mag in this custom made and embroidered Coonan Arms case.

doc-1: The barrel does not have the hinged link like on a standard 1911, but it does come out of the front of the slide the same way with the front barrel bushing. My test gun didn’t cycle .38 Special reliably even with the replacement thinner spring, but I am sure this is something that Coonan will be working on.

doc-2: Make sure to put the heavy spring back when you return to shooting .357 Magnum or you will put undue wear and tear on your gun. The Coonan Classic .357 is a high quality extremely good looking piece of firearm machinery that reflects the love of its makers.

As you know, they each have their strengths and weaknesses and each is definitely unique. 1. Coonan .357 Magnum Classic Stainless (MSRP $1,540) The Coonan .357 retails for $1,540.

doc-2: As you know, .357 Magnum rounds are relatively long and slender compared to typical pistol rounds, so, with the rounds being fed from a magazine, I wondered if Coonan managed to engineer the gun for reliable feeding…. Of course, they did.

doc-3: 2. Ruger LCRx (MSRP $579) The Ruger LCRx retails for $579. On the opposite extreme from the Coonan is this Ruger LCRx — a .38 Special +P, five-shot revolver with a 3-inch barrel. Weighing just more than 15 ounces, the LCRx feels like nothing in your hand.

doc-1: December 10, 2019 By Guns & Ammo Staff. The Roughneck is the newest member of the Bond Arms family of two-­shot derringer-­style pistols. Available in .357 Magnum/.38 Special, .45 ACP and 9mm, the Roughneck is simple to operate, reliable and safe, and with an MSRP of just $269, it’s not only the most affordable Bond pistol, but one of the least-­expensive defensive handguns on the market.

doc-2: Abbreviations: JHP, jacketed hollowpoint; LSWC, lead semi-wadcutter. I didn't test the five-inch model, but shooting the four-inch 686 was more than a blast from the past- it was an improved blast from the past. The .357 groups were larger not because .357 ammunition is less accurate but because it is more work to shoot.

doc-3: Pistol Ammo. Pistol and handgun ammo usually have a smaller caliber than shotguns or rifles, due to the size of the firearm. The most common calibers of pistol ammunition for sale on today's market are .22 Long Rifle, .380 ACP, 9mm, .357 Magnum and Sig, .44 Magnum, .38 Special, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP.

doc-1: The Henry Big Boy lever-action rifle comes chambered in a number of calibers, but the one I own fits into my revolver rifle combo set at .357 Mag/.38 Spl. The Big Boy by Henry Repeating Arms holds 10 rounds of either .357 Mag or .38 Spl. It comes with a 20- inch-long, octagonal barrel and a straight-grip walnut stock.

doc-2: The standard .22 Magnum LCR is a double action only model like this one. It weighs 15.1 ounces, which is actually a little bit heavier than the .38 Special version. The LCRx has an exposed hammer for a single action capability, and there’s also an LCRx with a 3-inch barrel.

doc-3: This became more difficult to pull off at longer distances, but the recoil with .38 load didn’t prevent me from adequately controlling 640 at closer range. .357 magnum: Not even once. Despite the barrel of the 640 Pro being marked with a very clear “.357 MAG”, I would not say this is a .357 magnum revolver.

doc-2: The Snake Slayer is Bond Arms’ most popular model, and comes with a 3.5” barrel, and is available chambered in either .357 Mag/.38 Special, or .45 LC/.410.

doc-1: But because the diameter of both bullets are the same and the pressure in a .38 Special is less than that of a .357 Magnum, a .38 Special round can be safely fired in a .357 Magnum revolver or lever gun.

doc-2: Most 9mm loads are 90 and 115 gn loads and most +P are 115 and 124 gn though 147 gn is becoming fairly popular. 357 comes in .357 mag the most common .357 round, .357 sig and .357 max. There are also rifle variations of .357 mag specifically loaded to be fired from carbines not hand guns. .357 mag is. Continue Reading.

doc-3: The brass is a bit taller however, so won’t chamber in a normal .357 mag. So it is more like the .38 special/.357 mag relation. You can fire a .38 in a .357 but not a .357 in a 38 and a .357 mag or .38 special in a .357 max but .357 max won’t fire in anything but a .357 max.

doc-1: Finally, in one place, a high end 357 will make 625 ft-lbs and 45 ACP +P will make about 460 ft-lbs. That obviously makes the 357 Magnum “more powerful”. But, in the real world, the majority of practiced shooters will be able to get 5–7 rounds of 45 ACP on target in the same amount of time as 1–2, 357 magnum rounds.

doc-2: However, the 10mm is more powerful than the .357 magnum of the same bullet weight, and most production full size 10mm pistols have a 15-round magazine capacity and so it totally smokes both the .357 magnum and .45 ACP with regard to practical matters concerning energy delivered to the target and capacity. 1.5K views.

doc-3: Light bullets, like these Barnes 80-grain TAC-XPDs, loaded by Doubletap Ammunition, reach velocities over 1,700 feet per second from a pistol. And it’s nearly the same. The “classic” loading of a .357 Magnum cartridge has a 125-grain, .357-inch diameter bullet launching at about 1,500 feet per second, give or take, depending on the specific load. The .357 Sig can do almost that, with most factory loads launching a .355-inch, 125-grain bullet between 1,350 and 1,450 feet per second.

For comparison, the .357 Magnum pushes a 125-grain bullet to 1,450 fps to produce 583 foot-pounds of muzzle energy from the same barrel length. Clearly, the .327 Federal Magnum is no wimp round. With less recoil and one more round than the .357 Magnum, the .327 Federal Magnum offers faster follow-up shots and one more bang instead of a click.

doc-1: by Brad Miller - Friday, July 19, 2019. More. SUBSCRIBE. The .357 SIG is a potent pistol cartridge designed in 1994 to replicate the ballistics of the .357 Mag. revolver cartridge and fit in a standard-size semi-automatic pistol. It does this very well with a 125-grain bullet at 1,350 fps from a 4-inch barrel.

doc-2: The Federal Premium 125-grain HST clocked at 1,454 fps, putting it on equal ground with a .357 Mag. revolver round from a 4-inch barrel. The Sellier & Bellot 140-grain FMJ bullet reached an average of 1,358 fps, which is the usual velocity of a .357 SIG 125-grain bullet from a 4-inch barrel.

doc-3: The KKM .357 SIG conversion barrel produced the best accuracy with the Federal HST. The average 5-shot group was 1.69 inches, and the aggregate group of all 25 rounds was 2.70 inches. The other loads shot well, too. The .357 SIG has a good reputation for accuracy and the M&P/KKM conversion demonstrates why.

doc-1: Keep in mind that frozen lobster tails WILL BE tougher than fresh - no matter what you do, so take great care cooking, or you will loose flavor and the lobster will be ""rubbery"". All that said, cooking time took longer than some folks for 1 pound tails, about 30 minutes, but well worth it!! The flavor was fabulous!!

doc-2: Soft-shell lobsters tend to be a little more tender and a little sweeter than their hard-shell cousins, according to most chefs. Meanwhile, hard-shell lobsters are often lauded for their brininess, salinity and oceanic flavor. Both have their attributes, but the hard-shells are not as forgiving of novice home cooks.

doc-3: Lobster – 140°F. Cooking lobster is straightforward. But like most all seafood, due to its tightly-bound muscle structure and lack of the lubricating fat that makes cooking meat a more forgiving process, lobster cookery can go wrong easily. You want to cook lobster just through.

doc-4: Cooking it too much makes for a rubbery, dry and unfortunate situation, and too little will result in an odd texture and undeveloped flavors. No matter how you cook you lobster, there seems to be agreement that lobster should be cooked to an internal temperature of 140°F, as measured in the tail.

doc-2: How to cook stone crab claws. We love just about every type of seafood, and stone crab claws are near the top of our list of favorites. What’s not to love? The crabmeat from stone crab claws is almost lobster-like in flavor, but the flesh isn’t as tough as lobster meat usually is. I think catching stone crabs is almost as enjoyable as eating the claws!

doc-3: Boiling Live Lobster. Boiling lobster is the certainly easiest way to cook lobster and a great way to enjoy the flavor of a fresh live lobster. The meat of a boiled lobster also pulls easily from the shell when cracked, making boiling an especially easy way to eat — as well as to cook — a fresh lobster. Steaming lobster can result in somewhat more tender meat, though, so if you have the equipment (a steamer pot, or even just a rack that sits inside your large pot) you might considered steaming as well.

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: A minimum size lobster will weigh around 1 lb., while a maximum size lobster will weigh between 3-4 lbs. The most plentiful, and most popular size of Maine Lobsters are 1 1/4 – 1 1/2 lb. each. If you are offered a smaller or larger lobster than this, you can guarantee it is not a genuine Maine Lobster.

doc-2: If you ever had a tough “lobster tail” served at a hotel banquet or on a mass market cruise ship, perhaps as part of a “Surf-and-Turf” platter, it was almost certainly the frozen tail of a warm water lobster, most probably a Caribbean lobster from the Bahamas or Honduras.

doc-3: First of all, a 9-oz lobster tail is big, so the challenge is getting it cooked through without drying out the top. If you overdo it, the meat will be tough and chewy. The general procedure goes like this: after the tail has been thawed in the refrigerator, cut open the top of the shell lengthwise with a pair of heavy kitchen shears. Cut through the meat with a sharp knife, but be careful not to cut through the bottom shell.

doc-2: Saffitz takes it a step further, explaining that the best meat comes from the lobster knuckle. The tail can be chewy and tough, she explains, and the claws are stringy and often over-cooked. ""The knuckle is already perfectly shredded, and so tender,"" she says.

doc-3: Although boiling lobster is easy, you want them to be tender, not tough - so you must master one key skill: don't overcook them! That's it - the ""secret sauce"" to serving up perfectly cooked lobster every time. If you accidentally under-cook the lobsters, you can always heat them up a little until they're perfect.

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Boiling Live Lobster. Boiling lobster is the certainly easiest way to cook lobster and a great way to enjoy the flavor of a fresh live lobster. The meat of a boiled lobster also pulls easily from the shell when cracked, making boiling an especially easy way to eat — as well as to cook — a fresh lobster. Steaming lobster can result in somewhat more tender meat, though, so if you have the equipment (a steamer pot, or even just a rack that sits inside your large pot) you might considered steaming as well.

doc-2: It was thought that when lobsters and other crustaceans molt, they shed all calcified body parts that might record annual growth bands. For their research, Kilada and five other Canadian researchers took a closer look at lobsters, snow crabs, northern shrimp and sculptured shrimp.

doc-3: A lobster also has a long tail which consists of most of its meat. As compared to lobsters, crabs also have a distinctive walk; they tend to walk sideways, whereas lobsters don’t. Lobsters also have larger claws as compared to crabs. Also, the meat of crabs is generally considered to be sweeter.

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: The reason many people believe larger lobsters are tough is simply because they overcook them. Many people will mistakenly boil a two and half pound lobster twice as long as a quarter pound lobster. Another common mistake is adding to the cooking time just because you are cooking more than 1-2 lobsters in the pot.

doc-2: Charlie prefers steaming lobster because he says it makes less of a mess and cooks up a more tender lobster than boiling. Steaming lobster preserves the ocean fresh taste of lobster. Since steaming cooks lobster a little slower, there is less of a chance of overcooking.

doc-3: Just fry the tofu first before cooking it in Step #3. Shrimps cook real fast, about 2-3 minutes. Make sure you don't overcook as it can get rubbery and tough. If you like tofu, you can add the Silken Tofu into the sauce to get a thicker consistency without adding much cornstarch and it makes the sauce creamy.

doc-1: Top of page. Most people think there is no difference in tenderness between the meat of small and large lobsters. However, cooking a lobster for too long can make it tough. Also, according to some people, meat from soft-shell lobsters is more tender than that from hard-shell lobsters.

doc-2: Cook the shellfish only until bright red, and prepare the lobster and shrimp while the lobster is still alive and the shrimp is as fresh as possible. These measures will prevent you from overcooking them and making their meat tough.

doc-1: Image Credit: Jupiterimages/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Boiling is a faster cooking method than steaming or roasting and, when properly timed, produces sweet, firm, perfectly cooked moist lobster meat. Because it is a high heat cooking method, timing your lobster to check for perfect doneness is crucial to avoid overcooking.

doc-2: Shrimp cooks quickly, and overcooked shrimp can be tough, rubbery and dry. As soon as the shrimp is pink, it's done. Jumbo shrimp takes about 7 minutes to cook, large shrimp about 5 minutes and medium shrimp cook in 3 to 4 minutes. Shrimp smaller than medium can take as little as 1 minute to cook.

doc-3: Tri-tip steak is generally lean, tender and reasonably priced. Because the steak is relatively moist, it is a good candidate for oven broiling. Take care not to overcook a tri-tip steak because overcooking may result in a tough, chewy steak. To keep the steak moist, broil the meat before trimming the fat.

doc-1: Many people will mistakenly boil a two and half pound lobster twice as long as a one and a quarter pound lobster. For timing, use the weight of individual lobsters, not the total weight of all lobsters being cooked. Unlike white fish, lobster meat has longer muscle fibers, and does not flake when cooked.

doc-2: The internal temperature should read about 135-140 degrees F. It is important to note when you take your lobsters out of the pot they will continue to cook. To stop the cooking process, put your lobsters in a big bowl of ice. If you overcook them, you will be eating tough lobster.

doc-3: Cooking lobster is an art, and if you do not get the timing just right, you might be in for a tough or chewy lobster. Never overcook your lobster. This makes the meat tough and stringy (a huge bummer!). We find most of the cooking time suggestions found on the internet are way too long.

However, boiling lobster tends to water-log them. If you are shelling lobsters ahead of time, go with boiling.

doc-2: If you are serving lobster as the main course, buy 2 to 2.5 lb. of lobster per person, allowing each guest 8 to 10 oz. of meat. If you will use the lobster meat in an appetizer or salad, buy 1 to 1.5 lb. of lobster per person.

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Size: Some folk seem to think that large lobsters are tougher or less flavorful than small lobster. I don't find this to be true. What is true, however, is that they are far harder to cook evenly. With most cooking methods, by the time you cook them through to the center, the exterior is hopelessly overcooked.

doc-2: Some folks find soft shell lobsters to be sweeter, more tender, and more flavorful. Others find that hard shell lobsters have a more intensely briny ""lobster-y"" flavor. We're planning a full blind side-by-side taste test, so stay tuned.

doc-3: The larger a lobster, the more you're likely to pay per pound, but increase in price does not indicate increase in quality. Some folk seem to think that large lobsters are tougher or less flavorful than small lobster. I don't find this to be true. What is true, however, is that they are far harder to cook evenly.

doc-1: For reference, a typical lobster you’ll find in the store or restaurant usually rings in at about 1-2 pounds and is around 5-10 years old. The bigger a lobster, (usually) the greater its age. However, molting takes more and more energy as a lobster increases in size and the amount of effort it takes for even a 30-50 year old lobster to molt kills between 10% and 15% of the lobsters every year.

doc-2: From Notes from a Maine Kitchen (Down East Books) by Kathy Gunst. Always remove the rubber bands from lobster claws before you cook them or you’ll have rubbery tasting lobster. Be careful once you remove the rubber bands because the lobster is very much alive and will snap at your fingers if you’re not careful.

doc-1: Lobster fishermen throw back lobsters that are too small and lobsters that are too big. The small ones need to grow, while the large ones add vigor to the gene pool. In Maine, a lobster’s body must be at least 3 1/4 inches to keep, and can’t be over 5 inches. When lobsters mate, the eggs aren’t fertilized right away.

doc-2: Brush the lobster tails with butter and place on the grill. Make sure that the tails do not burn – if there are any flames on the grill move the lobster away from it. Grill on each side for 4-5 minutes. Take care not to overcook your lobster or it will be rubbery and tasteless.

doc-3: Third, frozen lobster tails tend to be tougher than fresh, so there may be a bit of rubberiness no matter what you do. Nonetheless, they should be delicious! As to preparation, you can thaw them in the refrigerator for 8 to 10 hours or in a microwave oven (especially if it has an auto-defrost setting).

While it is possible to keep lobsters in a tank, there are many rules to follow to keep them alive and healthy. Set up the tank according to the manufacturer's instructions.

doc-2: Lobster (and all seafood) should be thawed in the refrigerator overnight. Do not thaw in a sink of warm water! Cook lobster as directed here ( once thawed ), until the internal temperature is 145 degrees F ( 63 degrees C ) as read by a digital meat thermometer. The meat will turn a white opaque color when done.

No matter how you cook you lobster, there seems to be agreement that lobster should be cooked to an internal temperature of 140°F, as measured in the tail.

Regardless of the type of meat being cooked, the higher the doneness temperature, the more juices will be lost and the less tender the results will be.

doc-2: Cooking it too much makes for a rubbery, dry and unfortunate situation, and too little will result in an odd texture and undeveloped flavors. No matter how you cook you lobster, there seems to be agreement that lobster should be cooked to an internal temperature of 140°F, as measured in the tail.

doc-3: You don’t want tough or rubbery lobster. You want soft and melt-in-your-mouth seared lobster meat. TIP: If the shells have not changed colour and are still green or their raw colour, simply use tongs to rotate the lobster in the hot pan juices until shells have changed colour.

doc-1: Here, we will be taking a closer look at how to cook your crab and lobster right. If you have frozen crab legs or lobster tails, you will typically want to thaw them in the refrigerator for between eight to 10 hours first. They can be cooked frozen, but this makes the meat somewhat tougher.

doc-2: The lobster will be sweet and tender, but will be less juicy than if the lobster is steamed or poached. If you own a steamer or have a steamer insert for a large skillet, try steaming the lobster. This gentle cooking method will ensure that the lobster will not be tough, as Maine Lobster mentions. It retains flavor best.

doc-3: Boiled Lobster Tails. Source. Boiling is one of the easiest ways to prepare this seafood and LobsterAnywhere agrees. This is the best method to use if you have fresh lobster tails as it will preserve the flavor. Cooking in water helps keep the lobster moist, but overcooking will make it tough.

doc-1: This transformation brings a sweeter taste, more tenderness, and a different color to the meat, in addition to the appearance of there being “less meat” in a soft shell lobster. This week, as we’re getting into soft shell season, we’re talking about the differences between the two kinds of lobster. Currently, it is hard shell lobster season.

doc-2: During the molten stage, the lobster’s muscle fibers grow in length about 14% with each molt, and they increase in width with age. This means that older, larger lobsters tend to be tougher when cooked. Hard-shell lobsters are meatier, and I prefer them for cooking.

doc-3: But it’s really easy to overcook lobsters, which can be chewy and rubbery. That’s why it’s quite stressful to cook them as they are so expensive. Say hello to sous vide lobster! Sous vide technique allows you to cook the food to the precise temperature you set, and you’ll get an even doneness edge to edge.

doc-1: Many people will mistakenly boil a two and half pound lobster twice as long as a one and a quarter pound lobster. For timing, use the weight of individual lobsters, not the total weight of all lobsters being cooked. Unlike white fish, lobster meat has longer muscle fibers, and does not flake when cooked.

doc-2: The internal temperature should read about 135-140 degrees F. It is important to note when you take your lobsters out of the pot they will continue to cook. To stop the cooking process, put your lobsters in a big bowl of ice. If you overcook them, you will be eating tough lobster.

doc-3: Cooking lobster is an art, and if you do not get the timing just right, you might be in for a tough or chewy lobster. Never overcook your lobster. This makes the meat tough and stringy (a huge bummer!). We find most of the cooking time suggestions found on the internet are way too long.

doc-2: Just make sure you do overcook your lobster as it will turn rubbery and tough. It’s easiest to remove the meat while the lobsters are still warm (not hot). If you do not have access to fresh live lobsters, a convenient alternative is to buy cooked frozen lobster meat.

doc-3: Spiny lobsters are a bit tougher and not as rich-tasting as the cold water Maine lobster tail. Fans of the “spiny” lobster know the texture and flavors are best appreciated when cooked LIVE. However, when it comes to shipping, this lobster is only shipped as tails because of where they are found.

doc-2: Baste again, and finish grilling shell side down. Grill tails until it’s just opaque in the thickest portion of the tail. Be careful to not overcook or tails will dry out and become rubbery. It’s OK to char the shell side of the lobster tail, but be extra careful not to char the flesh side.

doc-3: When cooked, its shell turns bright red to orange color. Its white flesh is firm and dense with a sweet flavor. Hard shell lobsters are the industry standard for quality with a higher ratio of meat to shell which means better value. Typically, the meat only makes up about 20% of the lobster by weight. Sure, soft shell lobsters are easier to crack, but hard shell lobsters have a better texture and are full of meat from claws to tail.

For the tourist a soft-shell lobster will usually be a good buy and a snap to open. This is due to the fact that a soft-shell lobster has less meat because it has not filled out its shell yet.

doc-2: Lobster weight by carapace length varies throughout the year since lobsters molt and shed their shells. On average a good hard-shell lobster will yield about 19-22% cooked lobster meat. Soft shell lobsters will yield much less meat per pound than hard shell lobsters.

doc-3: No sharing allowed, unless you order a large jumbo lobster! The larger lobsters not only weigh more but will have a higher proportion of meat. Hence, they will cost more per pound. Sometimes the real big lobsters can be cheaper per pound than Select lobsters. Graded lobsters are sold by size and by shell quality.

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: While some lobster aficionados believe the smaller lobsters are sweeter and more tender, we strongly disagree. Bigger lobsters give you a better yield, and the meat is no tougher than the smaller ones, unless, of course, you overcook them. You’ll get a lot of sweet meat out of a two, three—even a six pound lobster.

doc-2: One of the biggest misnomers is that big lobsters are apt to be course and tough. Not true at all. You’ll not only get more meat with a good hard-shell jumbo lobster, but the meat will be just as tender if it is cooked properly. Most of the cooking lobster cooking times we find online are much too long.

doc-3: The quality of the lobster meat starts with the quality of the lobster itself. Fresh lobster means: fresh caught live lobsters. Lobsters should be cooked live, iced to prevent overcooking; and the meat picked right on the spot. This does not mean cooking diseased, dead or dying lobsters—known in the industry as sleepers.

doc-1: Bad meat will give off an ammonia odor. Live lobster should be cooked properly, never overcooked or you’ll end up with rubbery and tough meat. The meat should be chilled and used right away or at least within a day or so. Note: Our lobster meat ships frozen to retain its fresh flavor and texture.

doc-2: Cooking times for boiled lobster: 1 pound lobster – boil 9 minutes. 1-1/4 pound lobster – boil 10 minutes. 1-1/2 pound lobster – boil 11 minutes. 1-3/4 pound lobster – boil 12 minutes. 2 pound lobster – boil 13-15 minutes. 2-1/2 pound lobster – boil 15-20 minutes.

doc-3: Boiling Live Lobster. Boiling lobster is the certainly easiest way to cook lobster and a great way to enjoy the flavor of a fresh live lobster. The meat of a boiled lobster also pulls easily from the shell when cracked, making boiling an especially easy way to eat — as well as to cook — a fresh lobster. Steaming lobster can result in somewhat more tender meat, though, so if you have the equipment (a steamer pot, or even just a rack that sits inside your large pot) you might considered steaming as well.

doc-2: If you ever had a tough “lobster tail” served at a hotel banquet or on a mass market cruise ship, perhaps as part of a “Surf-and-Turf” platter, it was almost certainly the frozen tail of a warm water lobster, most probably a Caribbean lobster from the Bahamas or Honduras.

doc-1: Either way, thawing your lobster correctly preserves freshness. Additionally, knowing how long to cook a raw or pre-cooked lobster in a microwave could mean the difference between a tender lobster or a lobster that's overdone.

The Best Way to Smoke Yellowtail. Like most fish and shellfish, lobster tails have to be thawed properly in order to preserve the flavor.

doc-3: Freezing. Since lobster is a fairly expensive delicacy, the logic of freezing it, and compromising the flavor and texture as a result, is flawed. The proteins in the frozen meat will bond to the shell, making the flesh hard to extract once the lobster is cooked. Lobster shouldn’t be frozen live.

doc-1: As for lobster meat and lobster tail, both will last between 3-6 months in the freezer. After 6 months, they are still safe to eat, but the taste and texture will change. Its meat may become more rubbery and it will lose its flavor.

doc-2: If it’s been in the freezer for a very long time, it will taste bland and become somewhat rubbery when you eat it. Frozen lobster will start to go bad when it starts to thaw. If you are thawing the lobster at room temperature, make sure to use it within 2-3 hours after it completely thaws.

doc-3: When the shrimp are thawed you can either keep them chilled and use them for a shrimp cocktail or in salads, or you could re-purpose them by cooking them in a hot pasta dish. If you choose to re-heat them then keep in mind that shrimp will get pretty tough and rubbery if they are overcooked.

Cold-water lobsters have meat in their claws and their tails, but the only edible meat you’ll find in a warm-water lobster lies in the tail. Cold-water lobsters have a sweeter meat than warm-water lobsters, the meat of which often has a fishier flavor.

doc-2: Know the difference between soft- versus hard-shelled lobsters — Lobsters with soft shells have a sweeter flavor, while hard-shelled lobsters have tougher meat. Take note of the fat content — Lobsters fresh from the ocean have higher fat content, which equates to high-quality flavor.

doc-1: Can You Cook Lobster Tails In The Instant Pot. While it might seem more complicated to cook lobster tails in an instant pot, it is actually incredibly easy, and keeps the lobster meat from getting too gummy or tough - plus it cuts down on kitchen prep and keeps cleanup to a minimum.

doc-2: Don’t rush the thawing process in the microwave. Defrosting lobster tails in the microwave will make the frozen lobster meat tough, in my opinion the meat is too delicate and cooks so quickly, it is just never going to defrost properly in the microwave.

doc-3: Steaming yields a more tender and flavorful meat since the lobsters aren’t submerged in the boiling water. It’s also more difficult to overcook lobsters when steaming.

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Serving lobster tails to your dinner guests or loved ones is always a special treat, so you want them to taste great! Lobster tails are easier to obtain than whole lobsters and easier to prepare. Buying a whole lobster is very expensive, and because most of the meat is found in the claws and in the tail. It is more economical to just buy a quantity of frozen lobster tails rather than the whole lobster itself and make these wonderful cooked Lobster Tails.

doc-2: How To Thaw Frozen Lobster Tails: Let the frozen lobster thaw in the refrigerator 24 hours before cooking. Cooking unthawed tails will result in tough meat. Lobster will thaw faster if placed in a plastic bag and immersed in water while in the refrigerator.

doc-3: How To Bake Lobster Tail: Place prepared lobster tails on a baking sheet, brush each lobster tail with melted butter, and bake approximately 15 minutes or until an instant-read meat thermometer register and internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees F. (do not overcook, as the lobster will become tough and rubbery).

doc-2: You want to buy only cold-water lobster tails because the meat is more firm and of higher quality. Thawing:As tempting as it might be, it's not a good idea to cook lobster while it's still frozen because the meat will become very tough.

doc-3: Keep in mind that frozen lobster tails WILL BE tougher than fresh - no matter what you do, so take great care cooking, or you will loose flavor and the lobster will be ""rubbery"". All that said, cooking time took longer than some folks for 1 pound tails, about 30 minutes, but well worth it!! The flavor was fabulous!!

doc-1: JADESTAR. Rating: 3 stars. 05/09/2011. My first time making lobster. I bought some good size lobster tails from Costco. Followed recipe exactly but there just was not a lot of flavor to this and the texture was kind of chewy. I didn't overcook it either. Will keep my quest going for the perfect way to prepare lobster.

doc-2: Product description. Tough, strong and durable, the Shun Classic 6-inch Meat Cleaver is an essential addition to any home or commercial kitchen. Designed for power, this heavy-duty tool can process whole poultry, lobster or meat with bones; spine of the blade also doubles as a tenderizer for tougher protein.

doc-3: Make sure you don’t overcook them so they’re not rubbery or tough. Even large shrimp only take a couple minutes to cook through. The lemon adds a wonderful brightness to the dish and is a perfect complement to shrimp. And anything tossed in butter automatically tastes great.

doc-2: Overcooked lobster will turn rubbery and have a chalky texture. Extreme overcooking can lead to dried out pieces of meat that are hard and difficult to chew. Because lobster continues cooking even when removed from heat, it is important to undercook slightly and give it some resting time before serving.

doc-3: eHow may earn compensation through affiliate links in this story. Lobster tail can be defrosted and cooked entirely in the microwave, producing juicy, tender, sweet, just-cooked meat. However, because microwaves cook unevenly, you need to pay careful attention during cooking and defrosting, to ensure that the tails do not become overcooked and rubbery in some parts.

doc-1: If the shell is a bright red color, or the meat is opaque, white with slight red mottling, the lobster tail has been precooked and can be eaten as-is after defrosting. While precooked lobster tails make for simpler preparation, they can be tricky, because reheating can sometimes cause the meat to dry out or become overcooked. Advertisement.

doc-2: Steaming, a gentler cooking method, can add delicate flavor to lobster meat and is a better option as it reduces the risk of overcooked portions of tail. However, it can take a long time to steam a 1-pound tail, upwards of 7 minutes per pound for a large lobster. Advertisement.

doc-3: Bring 6 cups of water to boil in a large stockpot. Drop the precooked lobster into the pot and cook for two minutes. This will just heat the lobster through. Do not over-cook, or the meat will become rubbery. Pull the lobster out with tongs and serve with your favorite dressings. Advertisement.

The cold waters of the North Atlantic keep the Maine lobster meat tender and prevent the saltwater from saturating the flavor of the meat.

doc-2: She has taken graduate courses in biochemistry and education. eHow may earn compensation through affiliate links in this story. The secret to cooking lobster tails is to cook them only until they're just done, because lobster can be tough and chewy if overcooked.

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: by the time a lobster gets to 3lbs, it is starting to get tough. long time cooking softens it up. a long time ago, we bought 6-8 lb lobsters in the waltham market. regular price $0.79 a lb. special, $0.69 a pound. those babies were tough. cook for about an hour, then chop them up for salad. Reply. slawecki.

doc-2: How to Cook Salmon. How to pan-sear, bake and grill salmon. How to Cook Frozen Salmon Without Thawing It. Here's how to pan-fry, bake and grill salmon from frozen. How to Cook Frozen Lobster Tails. We think broiling is the best way to do it, but we'll walk you through four other techniques too.

doc-3: You can cook certain types of frozen seafood without thawing it first, like salmon (see our Lemon Butter-Baked Frozen Salmon and Pan-Fried Honey-Garlic Frozen Salmon ). But you’ll want to thaw lobster tails before cooking them, otherwise they’ll end up tough.

doc-2: How to tell when your lobster is cooked. Care must be taken not to overcook the lobster, as this will result in tougher and less succulent meat. Overcooking also means that some of the delicious flavour will be lost and the meat may shrink, become stringy or even mushy.

doc-3: Do not remove the lobster from the pot before the shell has turned bright red. The lobster is properly done when an antennae comes off easily when pulled gently. The cooked lobster meat will be firm and white in colour. The internal temperature of the lobster meat will have reached 180°F (80°C).

    *Query*: Do larger lobsters become tougher when cooked?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Lobster selection and yield after cooking. About ½ the weight of a lobster tail is actual meat after cooking, although larger lobsters typically have a slightly better yield. Be aware that yields can vary by season. The weight generally varies between 3 ounces to 1 pound on larger tails.

doc-2: The taste of the cooked lobster is slightly sweet and briny, and because of its long muscle fibers surrounded by connective tissue, it has a similar texture as shrimp. Like other fish and crustaceans, lobster flesh cooks in just a few minutes and can turn tough and rubbery if overdone.

doc-3: If warm water lobster tails, flash frozen and shipped to your grocery store, are thawed properly and eaten quickly, they should have good flavor. Age. The older the lobster, the tougher the meat. If you’re shopping and have the chance to buy several one pound lobsters or a few large ones, get the little ones.

doc-1: How to Cook Previously Frozen Lobster. By Si Kingston. Ewelina Thepphaboot/iStock/GettyImages. It is often cheaper to purchase frozen lobster instead of live lobster. Frozen lobsters are also more convenient because you don't have to worry about cooking them right away. If you cook a lobster while frozen, the meat will often be mushy or overdone. To ensure you get the best taste, properly prepare your frozen lobster before cooking.

doc-2: By Cynthia Au. LuckyToBeThere/iStock/Getty Images. The succulent, sweet meat of a lobster tail is a true delicacy. Panfrying the meat is a great way to cook it for larger dishes like lobster pasta. Cook the meat in or out of its shell and season with a flavorful oil, spices or herbs.

doc-3: Serving and Doneness. Lobster is fully cooked when the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees Fahrenheit. Before the lobster reaches this temperature, the shell turns bright red and liquid in the tail coagulates, turning opaque and white. Overcooked lobster has a chalky, rubbery texture.

doc-1: Overcooking. If you bake muffins for too long or at too high a temperature, they will become rubbery and tough. This is particularly true if you are using a dark, non-stick pan, since these absorb heat better than other types of cookware.

doc-2: Many people will mistakenly boil a two and half pound lobster twice as long as a one and a quarter pound lobster. For timing, use the weight of individual lobsters, not the total weight of all lobsters being cooked. Unlike white fish, lobster meat has longer muscle fibers, and does not flake when cooked.

doc-3: The internal temperature should read about 135-140 degrees F. It is important to note when you take your lobsters out of the pot they will continue to cook. To stop the cooking process, put your lobsters in a big bowl of ice. If you overcook them, you will be eating tough lobster.

doc-1: Cooking lobster is an art, and if you do not get the timing just right, you might be in for a tough or chewy lobster. Never overcook your lobster. This makes the meat tough and stringy (a huge bummer!). We find most of the cooking time suggestions found on the internet are way too long.

doc-2: How to Boil Lobster. The shell of the lobster flavors the bubbling water, which in turn, flavors the lobster meat! For cooking a bunch of lobsters, boiling gives you even fast cooking. However, boiling lobster tends to water-log them. If you are shelling lobsters ahead of time, go with boiling.

doc-3: Baste again, and finish grilling shell side down. Grill tails until it’s just opaque in the thickest portion of the tail. Be careful to not overcook or tails will dry out and become rubbery. It’s OK to char the shell side of the lobster tail, but be extra careful not to char the flesh side.

    *Documents*:

doc-1: Although large lobsters might look impressive, smaller lobsters are more affordable and cook more evenly. If you’re new to cooking with lobsters, choose small lobsters: one-and-a-quarter-pound lobsters will be the easiest to work with.

doc-2: Buns: The second most important element of a traditional lobster roll is the bun. It's essential to use soft white-bread rolls and avoid hard bread. You want to be able to savor the lobster meat texture and lose it in chewing bread that is too tough. We also highly recommend using split-top hot dog buns.

doc-3: Although there are several ways to cook a lobster, we highly recommend boiling your lobster. Boiling is the easiest way to cook a live lobster for beginners, and it allows you to infuse the lobster with saltwater flavor. Boiling the lobster for the right amount of time also won't dry out the meat.

doc-1: The spears are tougher and more stringy when they get thick, so if the spear is harvested a bit later, the lower part of the stem will be tough and stringy, so most cooks will trim to base (the thicker part) off. The spears also get tougher and stringier if they sit around for days before preparing.

doc-2: New technology has made it possible to remove lobster meat from the shell while raw, but is still rarely available. Raw lobster meat will cook in about 3-5 minutes for claws and knuckles. Tail meat will cook in about 6–8 minutes for chicken sized (1–1.25lb whole) lobster.

doc-3: 1 Thaw the lobster tails. It’s absolutely essential that you thaw the tails (or claws) before you cook them. If you don’t, you are likely to end up with meat that tastes very tough. [3] . It’s a good idea to thaw the lobster for about 24 hours in the refrigerator before you cook it or at least overnight.

doc-1: Lobster is a tricky meat to get correct because if you don’t cook it properly or long enough the meat can get rubbery. Rubbery or hard to chew food is no bueno. Lobster tails are great dipped in garlic butter and served with some Garlic Cheddar Biscuits just at like Red Lobster.

doc-2: For both methods, the lobster tails are cooked when the meat is no longer translucent and the shells are a bright red. If you use a thermometer, the lobster meat is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 F. Avoid overcooking, as the lobster meat can become tough.

doc-3: Let them cook just a few seconds too long—whether poaching, searing, or grilling—and they go from tender and plump to rubbery and tough. With a sous vide cooker, you don't have this issue because that short window of time between perfect and overcooked stretches out to a good half hour or so.

doc-1: How to Cook Them (i.e., How Not to Overcook Them) As with littleneck or Manila clams, a prolonged cooking time will lead to rubbery and tough razor clams. If you’re pan-frying or deep-frying, cook them at very high heat, and make sure they’re in and out of the pan in under a minute.

doc-2: It’s possible to reheat cooked lobster to result in a dish that’s just as tender and delicious as you’d hope for. However, if you overheat the lobster, it will result in a tough and stringy texture. It’s best to heat the meat to 165° Fahrenheit to destroy any harmful bacteria that could lead to foodborne illness.

doc-3: Use A Live Lobster. As with other seafood, freshness is key for lobster. “Live is the way to go,” says Ezelle. “If you try to heat up lobster that has already been cooked, you’ll get a rubbery consistency. The best lobster is the one that is alive, then quickly dispatched and consumed.”.

doc-1: 1. Decide between a hard shell or a ""shedder. "" If you go to a restaurant that offers you the chance to choose your own lobster, you may be asked whether you want a hard shelled lobster or one that has recently shedded. Hard shell lobsters have matured enough that their shells are a little tough to break.

doc-2: Lobster fishermen throw back lobsters that are too small and lobsters that are too big. The small ones need to grow, while the large ones add vigor to the gene pool. In Maine, a lobster’s body must be at least 3 1/4 inches to keep, and can’t be over 5 inches. When lobsters mate, the eggs aren’t fertilized right away.

doc-2: Then water is added to the ground corn along with enzymes to convert the starch for fermentation. The mixture, also known as mash, is cooked to break the starch down further. The mash is removed from the cookers and allowed to cool before a second enzyme (glucoamalyse) is added to the mash.

    *Query*: corn mash
    *Documents*:

doc-1: For example, for every 1 gallon of water, you would use 1 pound of sugar, and 1 pound of corn meal. So for a 5 gallon mash (which is recommended for your first batches of moonshine) you would use 5 gallons of water, 5 pounds of corn meal, and 5 pounds of sugar. Now this recipe does not need to be exact by any means, because in the end it will be distilled and the alcohol is separated from the rest of the mash so preciseness is not necessary.

doc-2: roast made in the crockpot, corn, & mashed potatoes. barbequed grilled chicken, sweet corn, & green salad. breakfast for dinner {eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, & orange juice}. cobb salads.

doc-3: Rye whiskey – must be made from at least a 51% rye mash. Rye malt whiskey – same as above, except the rye must be malted. Bourbon whiskey – must be made from at least a 51% corn mash. Also, any whiskey branded as “Tennessee whiskey” is considered a Bourbon. Corn whiskey – must be made from at least a 80% corn mash.

doc-2: Part 1 of 4: Sprouting the Corn and Making the Mash. Sprouting kernel corn is a simple matter of getting it wet and allowing small sprouts to grow. Once the corn is sprouted, it's ready to be made into a mash. A mash is a combination of warm water and grain.

doc-3: The enzymes in the mash break down the starch in the grain and produce sugar. Start the sprouting process by soaking the corn with warm water. Place 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of untreated kernel corn in a burlap sack and place that burlap sack in a larger bucket or container. Then, saturate the burlap sack with warm water.

doc-1: Sour mash is popular in bourbon whiskey and Tennessee whiskey. Some popular examples of sour mash whiskey are Jack Daniel's and Jim Beam. On the other hand, Bourbon is an American form of whiskey made from (pursuant to US trade law) at least 51% corn, or maize, (typically about 70%) with the remainder being wheat, rye, and malted barley. It is distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof, and aged in new charred white oak barrels for at least two years- usually much longer.

doc-2: Buying and Making Laying Mash. Laying mash can be bought pre-made from feed mills, and buying pre-made feed can ensure you that the mash is a well-balanced diet for laying hens. However, mixing your own laying mash tends to be cheaper. For 250 pounds of feed, mix 30 pounds of soybean meal, 30 pounds of alfalfa leaf meal into 150 pounds of mixed grains such as corn, wheat, barley or rye to get a diverse grain and protein mixture and provide hens with carbohydrates and other vitamins.

doc-3: A mixture made of this grain powder, water and an enzyme enters a high-heat cooker, where it's liquefied. The enzyme helps to break down the grain compound to aide in the liquefaction process. The liquefied mash is cooled, and another enzyme is added to the mix.

doc-1: 27 CFR § 5.22 (b) (1) (i) “Bourbon whisky”, “rye whisky”, “wheat whisky”, “malt whisky”, or “rye malt whisky” is whisky produced at not exceeding 160° proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn, rye, wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, respectively, and stored at not more than 125° proof in charred new oak containers; and also includes mixtures of such whiskies of the same type.

doc-2: Smaller granules are more compact than their bigger brothers and therefore don’t allow water to flow through quite as easily. This is why corn typically requires more energy to mash than other grains. Corn starch is primarily made up of smaller compact starch granules, making their gelatinization more difficult.

doc-3: We start at 90°C (194°F) for corn and sit there for 30 minutes or so. Then we cool down to 70°C (158°F) and add our rye and sit for another 30 minutes before finally cooling to our saccharification temperature of 64°C (147°F).

doc-1: Blended whiskies (a combination of malt and grain whiskies) Cask strength (bottled from the cask undiluted, at a very high strength) Single cask (the bottle was poured from one cask) Whiskey has many more varieties available. They include bourbon whiskey, which is made with a mash that is at least 51% corn and aged in new charred oak barrels, rye whiskey, which is made with a mash that is at least 51% rye, and wheat whiskey, which is made with a mash that is at least 51% wheat.

doc-2: Then water is added to the ground corn along with enzymes to convert the starch for fermentation. The mixture, also known as mash, is cooked to break the starch down further. The mash is removed from the cookers and allowed to cool before a second enzyme (glucoamalyse) is added to the mash.

doc-3: Heat for 30 minutes (may vary by oven) and enjoy the creamiest mashed potatoes you've ever had! Stir before serving to ensure the potatoes are warm all the way through. If you are heating up a large container (2 pounds of frozen mashed potatoes or more), it will take longer. Stir every 20 minutes to ensure even heating.

doc-1: Other grains can be prepared in much the same way (e.g., rye mash). Mash or mush is made by adding boiling water to the cornmeal. The mash is kept warm to start the fermentation process. Yeast is added, if available (half pound yeast per 50 gallons of mash, for example), and sugar (variable recipes).

doc-2: Corn mash is the signature ingredient of bourbon. It’s made from crushed corn kernels, malted barley, water, and yeast. After these ingredients are combined, the mash is heated to start the fermentation process. Mash can be made from a variety of grains or even fruits, but bourbon is strictly made with 51% corn mash.

doc-3: You'll need to create a corn mash with a few basic ingredients (like crushed corn, malted barley, yeast, and sugar). Strain the liquid and distill it in a pot still. With a little time and effort, you'll soon be enjoying your own smooth, corn whiskey.

doc-2: 3. Stir the corn and check the temperature. Once the timer goes off, set the timer for another 5 minutes. Instead of stirring constantly, you only need to stir the corn for 5 to 10 seconds once the timer goes off. Continue briefly stirring the corn every 5 minutes until the temperature reaches 152 degrees F (37 C).

doc-3: Check the temperature of the corn mash once it's rested. It should be around 70 degrees F (20 C) before you add the yeast mixture. You can either let the mash continue to sit or use an immersion chiller to cool the mash. The immersion chiller is also known as a wort chiller.

For 5 gallons of mash, try using 7 lbs. of granulated cane sugar, 5.5 lbs. of cracked corn, and 1.5 lbs. of rye. Add water to get to the 5 total gallons of volume, and stir vigorously for a couple of minutes.

doc-2: The enzymes in the mash break down the starch in the grain and produce sugar. Start the sprouting process by soaking the corn with warm water. Place 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of untreated kernel corn in a burlap sack and place that burlap sack in a larger bucket or container. Then, saturate the burlap sack with warm water.

doc-3: Mashing. Barton uses only corn, rye and malted barley for their mash. Before mashing the grain is crushed in a hammer-mill before it is processed in the mash tub. Before the fermentation some of the residue of the still is added to the mash to provide a lower (better) pH-value for the yeast.

Generally, these sanctions focus on political groups or organizations that promote violence or social unrest, instead of the country's official government—though they can target government or military officials. For example, starting in December 2017, the United States has imposed targeted visa restrictions and financial sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act on ""perpetrators of atrocities"" in Burma (Myanmar).

doc-2: His 70 receiving yards per game marked a massive drop off from the 95.2 yards per game he logged in 2019 though he continued to find the end zone at a decent clip, scoring seven times in 2020. Godwin and Mike Evans will continue to see a similar target share as the Bucs look to become repeat champs in 2021.

doc-3: A common distinction is between ""Minor"" and ""Major"" power factor, and it determines the score value of peripheral hits. For example, in some divisions of USPSA competition, in order for pistol ammunition to qualify for Major, it must be at least .40 caliber and achieve a 165 power factor. Minor power factor ammunition must achieve a value of at least 125.

However, IDPA tends to differ from IPSC in the sense that it is geared more towards real-life scenarios. IDPA has differing rules that are designed to mimic what a shooter would encounter in a gunfight.

doc-3: Points Down. Originally the IDPA target was marked with two 5-point zones (head and 8-inch (20 cm) circle in center), a 4-point zone (a polygonal box around the circle), and a 2-point zone (the outside periphery of the target).

doc-1: However since scoring is obtained not by calculating points obtained but by subtracting points dropped, the scoring zones came to reflect that system. The current standard IDPA target is a cardboard humanoid shape with scoring zones perforated onto its surface.

doc-2: Range and target. The air pistol target is 17x17 cm with concentric score zones, the innermost (worth ten points) having a diameter of 11.5 mm. The distance from floor level to the centre of the target is 1400mm +/- 50mm. The air pistol range is the same as the air rifle range, giving each shooter a table, a 1 meter wide firing point, and a 10-meter distance between the firing line and the target line.

A shorter form is the National Match Course consisting of a single Slow Fire, a Timed and a Rapid Fire target, 30 shots for a maximum score of 300. Single gun competitions using only the rimfire pistol are common, as they provide an inexpensive entry into the sport.

doc-3: Outdoor competitions are typically fired at 50 yards (46 m) for slow fire courses and 25 yards (23 m) for timed and rapid fire courses. A ""short course"" shoots only at 25 yards and uses a reduced-size target for the Slow Fire segment. All courses of fire at an indoor competition are typically fired at 50 feet (15 m) with appropriately scaled targets.

doc-1: One change from the Original. While the main core aspect of the original game being a linear 3D platformer remains the same, only one minor tweek has been made. The Fire Flower power up now uses an automatic targeting system, where the Fireball homes in on any enemy that is caught in a new target circle.

doc-2: Cburlette. The term Major or Minor refers to power factor for IPSC competition, the term power factor is also used for IDPA shooting but there is no minor or major distinction. Power factor is simply the weight of the bullet X it's velocity (divided by 1000 for IPSC).

doc-3: In case you haven’t figured it out from being at a match yet, the zones are most often referred to as “A” = Alpha; “B” = Bravo; “C” = Charlie; “D” = Delta; “Miss” = Mike. * Edit: there is no longer a Bravo scoring zone on USPSA targets. The “B” zone is now part of the “C” zone.

doc-1: NRA B8 Target (Printable for FREE) This is our re-creation of the NRA B8 Target. It’s an official competition target for 25 yard sustained pistol fire shooting. It features 100% perfect dimensions, true to the original (do not “fit to page” when printing!). The normal version of this target is much larger, with the outer ring spanning a huge 20 inches in diameter.

doc-2: It’s especially useful when you’re having trouble distinguishing between the target, and a darker gun sight. It seems like it helps with my bad eyesight for sure! This NRA B8 target is a great way to practice for an upcoming official competition.

doc-3: Paper targets which have less than 2 hits will receive a 2.5 second penalty for each hit not in the scoring perforations. 9.1.6. Paper targets used in the match may be IPSC (old style), the new IPSC “Classic”, TSA, IDPA targets, or any other similar target approved by the Match Director.

doc-1: Target archery. Archers shoot stationary circular targets set at specific distances. Target archery is the discipline of shooting at stationary circular targets set at specific distances. Archers shoot over distances of up to 90 metres, although the standard competition distances are 70 metres (for recurve) and 50 metres (for compound), usually at the recognisable five-colour target, consisting of 10 scoring zones and gold, red, blue, black and white rings.

doc-2: Targets. International target archery competitions feature archers using recurve and compound bows. Archers in both competition categories shoot at the traditional five-colour target face with 10 concentric scoring rings. The target scores 10 points for the inner ring and one point for the outer ring.

doc-3: Scoring the IDPA 5×5 Classifier. The scores in IDPA are based on a combination of your hits on-target and the time you needed to make those hits. The IDPA target has three scoring zones, Down Zero, Down One and Down Three. A hit in the Down Zero portion does not add any penalty time to your score. A hit in the Down One adds one second to your score, and a hit in the Down Three area towards the edges of the target adds three seconds to your score.

The ‘Down Zero’ on an IDPA target is right about where the vitals are on a normal human.

doc-2: This target is a 1:1 scale representation of a 6 foot tall, 180 pound man drawing a handgun. The vital zone was shaped somewhat like a coke bottle.”. “As soon as NRA police competitions got started, everyone was shooting perfect scores on this target.

But the important point is because both are included, it's more predictive of future performance than target share alone.

Rounds generally must achieve a power factor of 120 or 125 to qualify for Minor power factor scoring, depending on the sport (IPSC, USPSA, IDPA, Bianchi Cup ), and heavy bullets are said to be more effective at knocking down steel plates even when they are at the same power factor as lighter bullets.

According to legend, it was invented by Bill Wilson, founder of Wilson Combat, and a serious competition shooter. Ideally, you want to use an IPSC or IDPA target, with all six shots in the A zone or 0 zone.

doc-2: Face Target – Fire 6 shots quickly – Only A Zone Hits Count. The target for the drill may be a standard International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) target or an International Defensive Pistol Association (IDPA) target. Only hits in the “A” Zone count (Down 0 Zone in IDPA) for this drill.

doc-3: The “A” Zone on an IPSC target measures 6 x 11 inches. The center body ring (Down 0) on an IDPA target is about a 9″ circle, with the head ring (Down 0) being about 6 x 6 inches. So you can make an IPSC or IDPA target “A” Zone (Down 0) target yourself.

    *Query*: why do some fighter jets have two pilots
    *Documents*:

doc-1: The best fighter jets in the world are built using state of the art and cutting edge technology in addition to having equally trained pilots. The United States Air force practice the most, more than any other country because they have financial resources to fuel up those jets and get pilots practicing mid-air combats.

doc-2: Calypso and Reflection Pass. These two maneuvers are meant to showcase the handling and dexterity of the F-16 fighter jets as well as the skills of the pilots. In the Calypso aerial maneuver, the two jets fly back-to-back. In the Reflection Pass formation, the jets fly belly-to-belly.

doc-3: The first officer, the second in command, sits on the right side of the cockpit. He or she has all of the same controls as the captain, and has had the same level of training. The primary reason for having two pilots on every flight is safety.

doc-4: Becoming a military pilot is a formidable physical and psychological challenge. Those hoping to fly fighter jets must prove their ability to withstand a high level of G-forces, or the equivalent of the force of gravity multiplied. That's why fighter pilots-in-training have to spend some time in a centrifuge to prove they can handle the pressure. ""Essentially, you are placed in a chamber that is on the end of a long arm that spins around the room — the faster it spins, the more G-forces you feel on your body,"" Jack Stewart, an active pilot with over 2,000 hours of experience in jet aircraft, wrote in an email to Business Insider.

doc-1: Viewed 106k times. 27. Why do some fighter jets have two pilots, while some have only one? For example the newer fighter jets such as Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter typhoon etc. are mostly with single-seat, but two-seat models of these jets are also available. aircraft-design fighter cockpit jet.

doc-2: It's primarily a question of pilot workload and military policy at design time. You'll notice that the primary two-seat fighters and attack planes in the U.S. armed forces (designation F or A) were designed in the late Korean through Vietnam eras, representing the third and early fourth generation of fighter design.

doc-3: As these systems were added to fighter cockpits in the early ""century series"", developing what would eventually be known as the ""multirole fighter"", pilot workload grew dramatically compared to the relatively simple layouts and weapons systems of propeller and early jet dogfighters.

doc-1: The primary reason any fighter aircraft would be designed for two crew members is work load. As avionics, sensors and weapon systems advance they become easier for a single pilot to operate, which is why far fewer fighter aircraft have two crew members now than in the past. Share. Improve this answer.

doc-2: 1. Others have already provided many details on the uses for two-seat fighters, US names and practices, etc. but note that for the Rafale specifically, the two-seat variant is not merely a training version.

    *Query*: why do some fighter jets have two pilots
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Other early jets generally had two engines because of their limited power, these being mounted in external nacelles for easier maintenance. With the advent of more powerful British jet engines, fuselage mounting was more effective, and it was used by nearly all subsequent fighter aircraft.

doc-2: The F-15E was designed in the 1980s for long-range, high-speed interdiction without relying on escort or electronic-warfare aircraft. United States Air Force (USAF) F-15E Strike Eagles can be generally distinguished from other US Eagle variants by darker aircraft camouflage, conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) mounted along the engine intake ramps (although CFTs can also be mounted on earlier F-15 variants) and a tandem-seat cockpit.

doc-3: USAF F-15C fires an AIM-7 Sparrow in 2005. A view of an F-15E cockpit from an aerial refueling tanker. This article is about F-15A, B, C, D, and related variants. For F-15E, F-15I, F-15S, F-15K, F-15SG, F-15SA, F-15QA, F-15X/F-15EX, and other F-15E-based variants, see McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. F-15A.

doc-2: J-15: Single-seat variant. J-15S: Two-seat variant, first flown in 2012. J-15D: Two-seat electronic attack variant with EW pods and other electronic equipment installed and IRST sensor removed. Begun operational testing in December 2018. J-15T: CATOBAR variant.

doc-3: The crew sat in tandem, with the flight instructor sitting behind the student on a raised seat to give a good forward view. There was a windblast screen between the two cockpits. The aircrew sat under separate clamshell canopies on Weber ES-7J zero-zero (zero altitude, zero speed) ejection seats, built by Daiseru.

    *Documents*:

doc-1: The tandem configuration has the advantage of being closer to the normal working environment that a fast jet pilot is likely to encounter. In some cases, such as the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler, a two-place aircraft can be lengthened into a four-place aircraft.

doc-2: Other early jets generally had two engines because of their limited power and mounted these in external nacelles for easier maintenance. With the advent of more powerful British jet engines, fuselage mounting was more effective, and it was used by nearly all subsequent fighter aircraft.

doc-3: Flying an aircraft requires much skill, practice, and a certain set of qualifications. Most aircrafts usually require two Pilots at a time during a flight. One of them is the Captain and will be Pilot in command of the aircraft, the other one is called the Co-Pilot or First Officer and their role is to assist the Captain.

doc-1: Ultimately, the Air Force does need a new air superiority fighter—particularly for the Pacific theater. The service is currently studying a new extremely long-range Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA) fighter that would replace the F-22 and F-15C as America’s primary air superiority aircraft. However, it is likely that the F-22, F-35 and PCA will all serve together in the coming decades.

doc-2: The shortage forced the Air Force to innovate. The service’s operational testers and Weapons School instructors—as well as frontline fighter pilots—devised ways so the F-22 could work together with conventional fourth generation fighters like F-15 so that the two types of jets could work together as an effective team.

doc-3: The aircraft is certified for operation with one crew member. The latest variant, the M2 is currently under development, it was launched in September 2011. The M2 is based on the out-of-production CJ1 variant and has similar avionics a new cabin layout and a more-efficient version of the William FJ44 engine.

    *Query*: why do some fighter jets have two pilots
    *Documents*:

doc-1: In fact, the rear seat is not a mandatory crew position, and F-15Bs are often flown with empty rear cockpits. The F-15C is an improved version of the original F-15A single-seat air superiority fighter.

doc-2: Well, there are several reasons for the controlled and intentional stall of a fighter jet such as testing the aircraft and training pilots to recover from stalls. During the design and testing phase of a fighter jet, the test pilots must ascertain the stall limits.

doc-3: One way to do it is to ascend tremendously quickly to the sky, like the astronauts inside a launching rocket or executing certain maneuvers on a fighter jet. Fighter jet pilots and astronauts can experience about 6 to 8 g of force. That's 6 to 8 times of the earth's gravity.

doc-1: Imagine the savings of being free to hire just one pilot rather than two for your travel needs. Also, if you plan to pilot your own jet, you may naturally wish you didn’t have to hire a co-pilot to join you in the cockpit. Good news – you have that option thanks to the single pilot class of light jets. Many single pilot jets have two seats in the cockpit, but they are rated to be flown by just one pilot, giving you the benefit of decreased operating costs.

A two-seat aircraft with plenty of room for electronic warfare pods and munitions racks—and air-to-air missiles in case enemy fighters come calling—would make for a great ""Wild Weasel,"" as these planes are frequently called. A U.S. Air Force F-35A performing over Lake Michigan, August 2018.

doc-2: With 2-pilot crews, this happens by default. A pilot who receives training and a type rating and then joins a crew is “monitored” just by the na­ture of the tandem operation. The same can’t be said of a single-pilot jet. Theoretically, after a type rating is obtained, a pilot can hop right in and fly solo.

doc-3: Extrapolating is complicated by several factors, including: nearly every pilot is qualified on multiple aircraft, if nothing else because of the various training aircraft they learn to fly; most fighters are single-pilot aircraft, whereas many of the larger cargo aircraft fly with co-pilot and co-pilot; and.

doc-2: Alternatively, Mortal Kombat 11 players on PC may have a chance to play as Kronika and other unplayable characters from story mode in the near future. A mod is in the works for the PC version of Mortal Kombat 11 that lets players play as not only Kronika, but Cyrax and Sektor as well.

doc-3: This total Tower score is then compared to other players' total scores, in what is called Race Against Time, and rewards are granted based on relative performance. For example, a fan that places within the top 99% of players in Race Against Time will receive 50,000 Koins, while someone that places in the top 5% will earn something like a Mortal Kombat 11 character skin.

doc-1: Where to Find & How to Get Cetrion’s Amulet in Mortal Kombat 11 Krypt? To find Cetrion’s Amulet in the Krypt in Mortal Kombat 11, you’re going to have to look in her Head Chest in the Warrior Shrine area.

doc-2: The Warrior Shrine is the path between the Shrine (the statue where you put Koins to get items) and the entrance into Goro’s Lair. Cetrion’s head chest is the fourth from the left from the door of Goro’s Lair. Inside is the Amulet, as well as some cool cosmetic items for Cetrion. The coordinates for the chest 2148, -5514.

doc-3: For more details, I invite you to check out our Mortal Kombat 11 Krypt Chest Locations – Koin, Soul Fragment, Heart Chests guide. So, yeah, that’s the only Skeleton Key in the Krypt in Mortal Kombat 11 that you can count on; the others you can only get by opening any of the hundred of chests in the Krypt. They are a very rare drop, but then again, your goal is to open all the chests eventually anyway, so you’ll get them eventually.

doc-1: The Krypt has wildly different pricing on its treasure chests, with just about every chest costing an absurdly large amount of koins compared to the other versions. It takes Mortal Kombat 11’s already shaky in-game economy and makes it even more out of whack.

doc-2: These giant hunks of rock will land every 4 or 5 minutes, and always strike somewhere in the central courtyard. By smashing them with your War Hammer, you can actually accumulate free loot - ranging from Forge Items, Aguments, and currency that can include a bit of Koins, Soul Fragments, or even Hearts!

doc-3: Reptile in the Krypt. There's a hidden character lurking around The Krypt, and you might recognize him - if you can find him. To find this character's cameo, you'll need to progress to Goro's Lair, and have at found at least two Skeleton Keys - which are sometimes found in chests ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 Koins.

Certain lesser doors that can be opened will give less - like 10 Soul Fragments, but are no less worth your time.

As backwards as it may seem, sometimes opening regular treasure chests with Koins can unexpectedly reward you with Soul Fragments. Certain chests may contain up to 50 Soul Fragments, and the randomly placed Kronika Vaults can give you up to 100 Soul Fragments!

doc-3: Location: This Key Item is only found in a Treasure Chest past the Door of the One Being near the entrance to Goro's Lair. Using all three fragments to open the door, dash past the flame traps to the end of the cave where you'll find an 80,000 Koin Chest that holds the Heart.

doc-1: IMPORTANT: Before you start it is extremely imperative that you understand how unlocking chests and treasures work. Many of the Treasure Chests and Soul Vaults are randomized in what loot they contain, both in the amount of koins it costs to open, and what you may find inside.

doc-2: One player may find a 5,000 koin chest in a specific location with a new fatality inside, while another player may find a 10,000 koin chest in the same spot in their krypt with a completely different reward. Because much of the Krypt it randomized, there is no way of telling what a chest contains.

doc-3: You may also start to find large orb chests that can appear anywhere in the Krypt each time you enter the Krypt. These are Kronika’s Vaults, and they always cost 5,000 Koins to open, and will reward you with 4 random items, usually cosmetics or Konsumables.

doc-2: Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004) Mortal Kombat: Deception built on everything that was great about Deadly Alliance, beefing up the roster while expanding on the single-player mode and introducing online play to the series. Newcomers such as Kobra and Hotaru joined returning fan favorites such as Ermac and Jade.

doc-3: Clash Royale ( Android, iOS) (Free) Supercell's Clash Royal features an interesting mix of tower defense and lane pushing gameplay, all within tight 3-minute rounds. Players must carefully balance offense and defense, and with the quick play rounds, a single mistake can swing an entire match. That said, the game is free to play, so expect some grindyness as you slog through matches in order to earn reward chests (which you must also wait to unlock), unless you shell out cash for premium currency.

Follow these basic steps to set a trap properly: Select a place in the surface runway where fresh work is evident and the burrow runs in a straight line.

doc-2: Typical costs: Gopher traps cost $5-$25, and mole traps can be $10-$60, depending on size, type and materials. Generally two traps are set at a time, back-to-back in the tunnel. Trapline Products provides how-to videos demonstrating basic mole trapping [ 1] and gopher trapping [ 2] techniques.

doc-3: 5. Trap moles humanely by digging carefully into an active tunnel. Make the hole wide enough to fit a large coffee can inside it, and dig a hole for the can so you can set it upright with the opening level with the bottom of the tunnel. Cover the entrance to the hole and check the trap in a few days.

doc-4: 1. Step on several mole tunnels in your yard to locate the one currently used. Examine the tunnels the next day, finding the one that has been rebuilt. This is the tunnel where you will place the trap.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: To be effective, the trap must be set to catch the mole underground. When a mole's sensitive snout encounters a foreign object in the burrow, the mole is likely to plug off that portion and dig around or under the object. Therefore, traps should be set to straddle or encircle the tunnel or be suspended above it.

doc-2: Moles are active throughout the year and can be trapped at any time. Before setting mole traps, determine which runways are currently in use. Moles dig a system of deep tunnels that are more or less permanently used as well as a network of surface runs used for feeding.

doc-3: In California, two major types of mole traps are most commonly used. These are the harpoon type and the scissor-jaw type. Moles have sometimes been caught with certain pincer-type gopher traps set in mole runways, but these are rarely as effective as the harpoon or scissor-jaw mole traps.

doc-1: The second type of mole runway runs deeper and is used to unite the feeding tunnels into a network. It is the soil excavated from the deep tunnels that homeowners find on their lawns, piled up in mounds that resemble little volcanoes. These mounds are a dead giveaway that your problem is not voles, but moles.

doc-2: There is no specific time when they are easier to catch. Moles dig in the same way at any time of the year, but they do tend to be more active during the spring, summer and fall. When moles are more active, they use their runs more frequently and thus have a greater exposure to a set trap.

doc-3: Study the tunnels to notice signs of recent activity; you should aim at setting the trap in the most active tunnel. The intention is to identify recent activities on the tunnel. This can be signified by the changes in the size of the mole hills or the tunnels. You can detect these changes by making marks on the burrow.

doc-1: Just set the mole trap on the surface mole tunnels, trap and remove the mole or two in your yard, and you'll have digging no longer. Unfortunately, mole trapping is not easy. The traps are not very user friendly. There are several types of mole traps, from harpoon to scissor traps ...click for more.

doc-2: Knowing how to trap a mole takes some experience. If you are going to trap a mole yourself, you need to purchase some body gripping traps. Find an area where the mole has created a long, straight tunnel through the sod. Using a garden tool cut the sod away and secure the trap inside of the tunnel.

doc-3: Replace the sod and flag the area so you remember where the trap was set. The trick to trapping moles is to place the device in an active tunnel. This type of knowledge is gained through experience, which is why hiring a professional for mole removal may be the best idea. How to Get Rid of Moles in the Lawn.

doc-1: Body gripping traps are the most common, though spear traps and scissor traps are used as well. Mole traps are placed into an active tunnel with the sod replaced on top. The traps must be secure and stable or the mole may not approach. The traps are checked daily and the bodies removed.

doc-2: The mole looks for bugs and grubs in the soil and will tunnel to them rather than retrieve them from aboveground. To get rid of moles, a professional will be able to determine which mole tunnels are active and which tunnels were only used once. Traps will then be placed inside the active tunnels.

doc-3: If changing your garden habits is not an option, the moles must be lethally trapped and removed. There are no live traps for moles because the animals live underground. Lethal traps are placed in active tunnels and are checked regularly for activity. Once the moles are removed, the landscape needs to be repaired.

doc-2: Damage And Signs Of Mole Infestation. Moles live underground and dig expansive tunnel systems both to live in and feed. These tunnel systems are easily visible from the surface in the form of raised ridges that follows an underground tunnel. Molehills also arise along the route of the borrow or side tunnels.

Note: These contractor costs are based on a hypothetical job. Under slab plumbing repair costs could vary approximately 50% or more because of different conditions. Repair costs are influenced by other factors such as trees, landscaping, driveways and patios, number of plumbing line breaks, cost of materials, the overall length of trenching and tunneling, etc.

doc-2: 4. Set a trap. You'll need to buy a trap designed specifically for moles. There are two types of traps to choose from: a harpoon trap and a scissors trap. In either case, the mole will run inside and immediately be killed. Set a harpoon trap by making a well over an active tunnel.

doc-3: 5. Check the trap. Once you've set your trap, you'll need to check it every day to see if you have caught a mole. If you do not find a mole in 4 to 5 days, you might have set the trap in a tunnel that is no longer in use. You'll need to move the trap to a different location.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Many exterminators stand by the opinion that trapping is the only way to rid a lawn of moles. Trapping these diggers takes a working knowledge of their activities and tunneling habits. Mole traps also differ from mouse traps in style. The anatomy of a mole is not exactly like that of a mouse, so mouse traps will not always work, nor will a mole be enticed to a mouse trap the way a mouse is.

doc-2: So now you can understand the importance of having a leak free system. I hope this helps ... ...Show more. Source (s): http://www.customcraftexteriors.com/heating_and_co... freddy. 1 decade ago. the best answer i can give you is to put the unit into a ratio/ decide how old the unit is to how expensive the unit would be to fix. with a small leak the freon would have to be evacuated and then the leak would have to be found and then fixed. once the leak has fixed and it is ran threw a vacuum to test for other leaks. it may have more or none. then the freon is put back into your lines and more is added now that job can be minimal or very pricey depending on where your leak is and how hard it is to fix. so i would start there most companies have a price range that they can give you for repairs. now commonly if you've had a leak big or small most freon can leak fast because of the pressure and if the freon has been gone for some time the compressor may have failed. some compressor may lock up and others may stop running but all compressors are damaged if there are no freon going through them when they are running. now it may be common for your heat pump to get topped off every now and then since your technician may take a little each time when they service it and that might be why your losing it but someone would have noticed the failure or leak by then.plus with r-22 phasing out there is a chance that you may need a replacement since its hard to find. therefore you need to waver the cost of repair to the cost of a new one i myself would choose a new unit giving the price of an expensive leak change.

doc-3: Bear trails can be seen where bears approach favorite marking trees. These trails are often especially distinctive because bears frequently stomp-walk as they approach such trees. Stomp-walking is a form of scent-marking in which bears stomp, twist, and slide each footstep.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: To determine if a tunnel would make a good trapping site, determine whether it is currently in use. Step on a tunnel to compress the soil. If a mole is actively using it, the mole will raise the soil or turfgrass within approximately 24 hours.

doc-2: Just assemble the trap and set it up in an active tunnel to catch the mole. Three of the most popular types of mole traps are lure traps, circular rodent traps, and loop choking style traps. Using bromethalin mole baits that look like earthworms might also work in getting rid of moles.

doc-3: To help decide how to get rid of the burrowing creatures, you’ll want to determine the extend of your mole problem and which tunnels are active. There’s a simple test — find a mole tunnel and stomp down on top of it so that it partially caves in.

doc-1: Using Mole Traps : Talpirid and Victor. As with all mole control treatment methods, (particularly with trapping), patience and persistence are the key words. Trapping moles with mole traps is usually easiest during the spring and fall with mole activity is at a peak.

doc-2: Trapping is most successful during the spring and fall months after a rain. Moles are more difficult to locate in the summer and winter months, since their tunnels are deeper in the soil. When using a mole trap, locate the active runways first. Do this by stepping on a run or mound and mark the location.

doc-3: This specially designed ""hands-free"" mole trap is fast and easy to place and set. After identifying and properly preparing an active mole tunnel, simply place the trap jaws in the active mole tunnel and step on the trap's yellow foot pedal which sets the trigger below the surface.

doc-1: Mole Habits - Mole Tunnels. Moles produce two types of runways (tunnels); sub-surface runways and deep runways. Moles build vast underground tunnels in search of worms, insects and nesting/living space. Mounds form a row of excavations unlike the random excavations of a gopher.

doc-2: Burrowing activity occurs year-round but peaks during warm, wet months. Some of these tunnels are used as travel lanes and may be abandoned immediately after being dug. Mounds of soil called molehills may be brought to the surface of the ground as moles dig deep, permanent tunnels and nest cavities.

doc-2: Quick facts. Most experts agree that trapping is the most effective way to control moles in a garden. Although trapping moles is not difficult, it does require a general understanding of the mole's tunnel system and learning how to use the right trap effectively.

doc-3: Finding an active mole tunnel. Moles dig deep tunnels where they bear their young and retreat during very dry or cold weather. Conical piles (molehills) of excavated soil often cap these deep tunnels. Ignore the molehills and concentrate on the network of surface tunnels.

doc-2: Moles. As moles create deep tunnels, or encounter roots, rocks or hard to compress clay soils in shallow tunnels, they push the excess soil out of the tunnel and to the surface. These so-called mole hills can be from 2 inches to 24 inches tall and are volcano shaped. Over time, they may flatten and become a bare area.

doc-3: Traps should be placed over an active tunnel and are the most effective in the fall and winter months. Snap traps, such as a mousetrap baited with peanut butter, are not effective in catching moles. Moles are solitary animals, so ridding the landscape of one or two moles will make a big difference.

doc-1: Typical costs: Gopher traps cost $5-$25, and mole traps can be $10-$60, depending on size, type and materials. Generally two traps are set at a time, back-to-back in the tunnel. Trapline Products provides how-to videos demonstrating basic mole trapping [ 1] and gopher trapping [ 2] techniques.

doc-2: Home Guides. |. Garden. |. Landscaping. By Daniel Thompson. Mole traps are an effective way to control moles that does not rely on toxic baits or fumigants that could harm your pets. To use a mole trap effectively, you must identify which tunnels the moles are actively using and then correctly install the trap inside the tunnel. There are three basic types of trap that you can use known as the scissor, harpoon and choker loop traps.

doc-3: 3. Wait 24 hours and then check the spots where you collapsed the tunnels to see if they were reopened. Remove the cloth strips from the tunnels that are still collapsed since the moles are not actively using them. Set a mole trap in each tunnel that shows signs of mole activity.

doc-1: Mole Repellents and Deterrents. If the benefits of moles aren't enough for you to want to leave them alone, the best method to deter a mole is by trapping it. Traps must encircle or straddle an active tunnel or be suspended above it. Identify an active tunnel by collapsing the tunnels.

doc-2: 5. Trap moles humanely by digging carefully into an active tunnel. Make the hole wide enough to fit a large coffee can inside it, and dig a hole for the can so you can set it upright with the opening level with the bottom of the tunnel. Cover the entrance to the hole and check the trap in a few days.

doc-3: 1. Walk around your yard and search for tunnels. Each time you find one, step on it to collapse the opening. Come back the next day and look for rebuilt tunnels. They are active tunnels in which setting traps will be effective.

doc-1: Trap The Moles. Deterrents are a better preventative solution than they are at dealing with a full infestation. If your mole problem is already full-fledged and/or persistent, then trapping them is the next thing to try, and it’s what I recommend to those wondering how to get rid of moles in yard and lawn spaces.

doc-2: How to Find the Active Mole Run. To determine the active run, flatten the mole tunnels and mark them. Check your lawn periodically throughout the day. A raised run (after you’ve flattened it) is the active one and where you’ll set the trap. Once you’ve found the active mole run, insert a trap into the active run.

doc-3: Moles become active in early spring, and it’s best to set the traps then, once you notice the tunnels starting to form. You can either use a humane trap to release them elsewhere, or a kill trap to get rid of them altogether. If you decide on a humane trap, you’ll need to release the mole after catching it.

Here are several tips on how to use a mole trap properly that you should know when there are active mole tunnels in your garden: Put the soil back into in the tunnel. Try to put the compressed area under the legs of your trap and then firmly and deeply press them into the ground.

doc-2: Conclusion. In general, please pay attention to your trap setup because this is what will decide if the mole gets trapped or not. To maximize your success rate, you should do a little research on the mole’s habits as well as the mound to ensure that you place your trap in the right position.

doc-3: Trapping is the most reliable method of mole control, but requires careful observation of tunneling activity to determine where to place the trap. Mole activity is most noticeable in fall and early spring. Areas damaged by moles should be tamped down by foot or flattened with a lawn roller.

doc-2: Study the tunnels to notice signs of recent activity; you should aim at setting the trap in the most active tunnel. The intention is to identify recent activities on the tunnel. This can be signified by the changes in the size of the mole hills or the tunnels. You can detect these changes by making marks on the burrow.

doc-3: You can then observe whether the burrow is raised after some days. Also, moles dislike light entering into their tunnels. You can make a small hole on the top of the raised tunnel. If the tunnel is active, the hole will not be there the following day. If inactive, the hole will remain.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: Most likely, you won’t see the moles but for the burrowing signs on the soil surface. Considerations are (1) safety for humans to handle, (2) humane mole trapping, (3) dependable or effective each time, and (4) ease of setting up the mole trap. What are the best flea sprays for the yard?

doc-2: That’s because the trap comes with a wedge and a probing tool which should make it a lot easier to detect the location and direction of the tunnels. Using the wedge, you should be able to expand the diameter of the tunnel just enough to accommodate the spring-loaded trap without collapsing it.

doc-3: The secret is: To know where to place the trap, look for tunnels that moles have been using recently and flatten the soil pushed up by the rodents. Check next day to see if the soil has been pushed up again. If the soil has been pushed up again, this is an indication that the tunnel is active.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: The first one is the harpoon trap which sharp spikes pierce the mole. The second type is the scissor-jaw trap with jaws closing firmly across the runway, while the third one is the choker loop trap with a loop tightening around the body of the captured animal. These traps have two crucial strong points.

doc-2: Make a hole in a tunnel or press down a small section of the tunnel. Mark these sections and wait 24-48 hours. If the tunnel that had been flattened has been raised up or the hole has been resealed, the burrow is active. Only treat active burrows.

doc-3: You may place cages with a bait near the burrows or the place where you notice mole activity. Another way to trap the moles is placing a glass jar or glass bucket under one of the tunnels in a way that the mole will fall in it while moving through the tunnels. Once inside the glass jar, it will not be able to come out.

Remove the side plug from the crescent-shaped gopher mound or the center plug from the conical mole hill. For tunnels and runways, carefully create an opening, taking care not to drop soil into the run.

doc-3: Moles will have their litters anytime from mid-March into May; trapping in the early spring (late February to early March) can eliminate pregnant females, effectively nipping in the bud what would be a greater mole problem later. Where you place the trap is critical to your success in trapping.

    *Documents*:

doc-1: You’ll want to place your mole trap near active mole feeding tunnels (that is, the shallower of the two types of tunnel described above). Active runs can be located by stepping down the run, marking the location (say, with a ribbon tied to a stake), and checking to see if the tunnel is reopened within 24 to 48 hours.

doc-2: Cut out the turf over the active tunnel, and remove the soil right down to where the moles have beaten their path. While their vision is poor, however, moles are sensitive to the touch. This means you can't leave any loose soil in the path leading up to the trap, or the moles will detect it and back off.

doc-3: Set the trap according to directions. If a trap fails to produce after two days, it can mean that: · The mole changed its habits and is no longer using the runway. · The runway was disturbed too much, alerting the mole to potential danger. Try not to leave loose dirt in the tunnel when you set the trap.

doc-1: Harpoon Trap. Once triggered, this kind of trap spears the animal with its spike. Some people call this method a spear trap or plunger trap. A trap like this uses a trigger pan that is placed in the soil. If a mole shows up, the force upward sets off the trigger pan, which lowers down a sharp spike towards the mole.

doc-2: When used incorrectly, the harpoon trap may stick out over the ground. This can cause harm to other people. In setting a harpoon trap, put and secure the trap above the tunnel runway with its legs pressed down into the bottom of the sides of the tunnel.

doc-3: This type of trap is also called as loop trap. Its main function is to encircle the neck of the mole to capture it. In contrast to other traps, the choker trap does not use some baiting. Some people find it difficult to set this particular trap.

Make a deeper opening than the original depth of the tunnel, although the width should be similar as the tunnel.

doc-2: The moles somehow know that the traps are touched by a human. Hence, they tend to avoid them. To be able to find an active mole, stomp on top of the mounds.

These feeding tunnels are used a few times, then abandoned. Deeper tunnels from which the mole must dig dirt, forming molehills, are used mainly as the living quarters.

doc-2: Total. $2875. $10,556. $18,925. The cost estimates above were calculated by Dawson Foundation Repair and an independent plumbing company. Note: These contractor costs are based on a hypothetical job. Under slab plumbing repair costs could vary approximately 50% or more because of different conditions. Repair costs are influenced by other factors such as trees, landscaping, driveways and patios, number of plumbing line breaks, cost of materials, the overall length of trenching and tunneling, etc.

doc-3: Mark these sections and check again after 24 hours. The burrow is considered active if the flattened runway has been raised up or if the roof has been fixed. Make sure to treat only active burrows. Punch a hole carefully on top of active tunnels, drop a teaspoonful of product and close the hole with sod or stone.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: A. Since the Wilco Gopher Getter Type 2 Bait is applied directly in tunnels it would be protected from rain unless it was a heavy downpour that flooded the tunnels. This bait must be placed in the gophers’ active runway for four (4) consecutive days or until activity ceases so if you would not be able to have a break in the rain to do so, then it would be best to wait until you had 4 clear days.

doc-2: Using Mole Traps : Talpirid and Victor. As with all mole control treatment methods, (particularly with trapping), patience and persistence are the key words. Trapping moles with mole traps is usually easiest during the spring and fall with mole activity is at a peak.

doc-3: Trapping is most successful during the spring and fall months after a rain. Moles are more difficult to locate in the summer and winter months, since their tunnels are deeper in the soil. When using a mole trap, locate the active runways first. Do this by stepping on a run or mound and mark the location.

doc-1: Step 1: Finding the Moles. Just because you have a number of mole tunnels in your yard doesn’t mean these are active tunnels. To find active tunnels, push down some of the soil in each different tunnel. Wait 1 or 2 days to see if the tunnel has been raised again.

doc-2: Whether you set up a live or a spring-loaded trap, the first step is to locate the active tunnels. Step on the tunnels you see in one or two spots to collapse them, then check those spots the next day. If the tunnel has been dug out again, it's an active one, and a good spot to set a trap. 16/16. Selosh/Shutterstock.

doc-3: The mole will fall in, and then you can take it to a new location. However, the most effective, time-tested mole trapping method is to set up a spring-loaded prong or choker-loop trap that is activated when the mole pushes against it.

doc-2: Mole Trapping Tips. The prime seasons to be trapping moles are the Fall and the Spring. The earlier you start from these seasons, the better, as warm rain draws out the worms which moles so fervently cherish. Before storing away a trap, it should be cleaned so that dried mud does not interfere with further usage and effectiveness.

doc-3: Do not make an overly big mess during the process of locating a mole’s runways as too much tunnel disturbance can cause a mole to relocate, causing your trap to fail. Don’t be discouraged if your trap fails to capture a mole after two or even three days. Simply move the trap elsewhere.

doc-1: Trapping moles is made relatively easier than snatching other carnivorous critters because most of these traps don’t require a bait to work. The first thing when it comes to trapping a mole is learning how to locate its frequented tunnels, known as runways.

doc-2: For mole trapping, use step 4 of this section. Use the shovel to dig around the burrow hole. Locate the tunnel system and find the main trunk; this will appear between 8 inches to 24 inches below the surface. Set a trap into the tunnel so that it faces the direction of the tunnel.

doc-3: Find out if you have moles or gophers, as each requires different trapping methods. Set a trap into the tunnel so that it faces the direction of the tunnel. Place the mole trap over the top of the tunnel. Set the trap so that it straddles the tunnel.

doc-1: Do not set the traps at the end of a tunnel. It should be in the center of a long tunnel or close to where another active tunnel breaks off. The number of traps set depends on the amount of active tunnels you have. Three or four traps is okay for an average sized lawn with a lot of tunnels.

doc-2: The following methods are the most effective for the control of mole damage in lawns. I. Direct Killing. For Eastern moles, flatten the tunnels and then identify those that are repaired the next day. Flatten them again and check them periodically through the day to see when the moles are active.

doc-3: Trapping Moles. Eastern Moles - Trapping is the most effective method of mole control. Carefully place traps in active tunnels (i.e. those that were repaired 12 to 24 hours after being flattened). Work the harpoons or jaws of the trap gently through the soil to insure smooth penetration.

doc-1: If traps are sprung prematurely, remove a small piece of sod from under the trigger pan to delay the action of the trap. If moles burrow around a trap, the soil has been flattened too tightly or part of the trap is projecting into the tunnel and is alarming the mole.

doc-2: Be sure no light can penetrate into the tunnel near the trap. Starnose Moles - To trap starnose moles, locate an active tunnel by flattening the mounts of soil. Mounds that are pushed back up in 24 to 48 hours are over active tunnels. Beneath one of the mounds, dig a hole 4 to 6 inches deep to the bottom of the tunnel.

doc-3: Refill the hole with enough soil to cover the tunnel and then set the harpoon trap in the hole. If the trap is set in an active tunnel, it should catch a mole within 24 to 48 hours. If not, reset the trap and check for problems such as light getting into the tunnel or the trigger mechanism need adjustment. III.

    *Documents*:

doc-1: A: Moles dig their tunnels on several levels or depths and use different parts of the tunnel system depending on conditions. Visible mole activity comes from the uppermost tunnel systems. These tunnels are just a few inches deep. The main diet for moles is worms and other insects that live in the soil.

doc-2: A: The simple answer is: in the winter we usually have more rain; thus insect life is closer to the surface, moles are active where the food source is. The molehills are just the spoil from digging tunnels; it is easier for moles to get rid of this spoil on the surface when the tunnels are shallow.

doc-3: How to Repair Veining Damage. Moles activity often looks like large raised veins spreading across your yard. These vein-like patterns are actually surface tunnels or feeding runways and moles can construct them at a rate of 10 feet per hour. Luckily, damage as a result of veining is relatively easy to fix:

doc-1: Organic control methods. Depending on the life stage of the pest, different control methods can be applied. As moles overwinter in their burrows, they become active in the spring, when they start mating. Once the eggs hatch, they grow and eat during the summer, when most of the damage can be seen. Applying a treatment in the winter, while they are hidden in the soil might stop them from further tunnelling, however the most effective treatment is the one applied in summer, which affects the nymphs, when they are vulnerable.

doc-2: TRAP. Another way to protect lawn and landscape is with a safe, effective, no-spear trap like Tomcat Mole Trap. Be sure to set the trap in an active runway. To identify the active runway, look for a straight tunnel, often around your yard's perimeter.

doc-3: Both gophers and moles can be trapped for relatively easy pest control, but knowing whether your pestis a gopher or a mole is critical for choosing the right trap. A trap that is large enough to catch a gopher may be ignored by mole, and a trap that is small enough to catch a molecan be evaded by a gopher.

doc-1: To use the trap, use your hands and feet to push down on the grass above the middle of an active tunnel. You can then set the trap by pulling at the handle spring at the top of the trap and forcing the small level to hold the trap in place. Make sure that the trap is up enough to catch the trigger.

doc-2: Wrong Tunnels. Along with placing traps at the ends of tunnels, another big common mistake is placing the traps in the wrong tunnels. The instructions of any trap will state to place it in an active tunnel. If there is a long, active trail one can tell by feeling the soft ground.

doc-3: Scissor traps. Scissor traps like the others are placed on active tunnels created by the mole. When the mole crawls through the tunnel it causes the blades to snap together, killing the mole. This is the easiest and most popular of the three types of traps to use because of how simple the design is.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?

doc-1: The reason for these treatments is so that new moles don't take up residence in old tunnels. An active mole will leave its scent to mark its territory. If a mole stumbles onto a marked tunnel, it will move on. If no scent is present, it will use these tunnels as its own. This is called ""recolonization"".

If a mole stumbles onto a marked tunnel, it will move on. If no scent is present, it will use these tunnels as its own. This is called ""recolonization"".

doc-3: Use Traps. An effective way to get rid of moles is to trap them. There are several types of traps available, such as the Tomcat Mole Trap. You'll have more luck if you trap in the spring or fall, and if you set your traps in a main runway. These are usually straight, or they can follow the perimeter of your yard.

It is the soil dug up from the deep tunnels that homeowners find on their lawns, piled up in mounds that look like little volcanoes.

doc-2: Scissors mole trap. Choker mole trap. Harpoon mole trap. You can also trap moles using a small live-trap, for catch-and-release removal. The problem with this method, however, is that you still have to get rid of the live critter after you've trapped it. In some states, animal relocation is actually prohibited.

doc-3: Trapping in the early spring can get rid of pregnant female moles, effectively nipping in the bud what would be a greater problem later. Where you place the trap is critical to success. Place your mole trap near active feeding tunnels (that is, the shallower of the two types of tunnel described above):

doc-1: Check back within 12 to 24 hours, to inspect the ridges you've flattened. If the ridges of soil are pushed back up, you'll know that the mole regards this tunnel as an active tunnel. Cut out the turf over the active tunnel, and remove the soil right down to where the moles have beaten their path.

doc-2: The second type of mole runway runs deeper and is used to unite the feeding tunnels into a network. It is the soil excavated from the deep tunnels that homeowners find on their lawns, piled up in mounds that resemble little volcanoes. These mounds are a dead giveaway that your problem is not voles, but moles.

doc-3: You may place cages with a bait near the burrows or the place where you notice mole activity. Another way to trap the moles is placing a glass jar or glass bucket under one of the tunnels in a way that the mole will fall in it while moving through the tunnels. Once inside the glass jar, it will not be able to come out.

doc-1: You’ll have the most luck killing moles in your yard if you use traps or bait in the spring or fall. Both products should be placed in a main, or active, runway. These are usually the straight tunnels in your lawn or the tunnels that follow the perimeter of your yard. To identify a main runway, carefully poke holes in the top of the runway using your index finger, half-inch dowel, or small probe.

doc-2: Surface Runways. Surface runways appear as raised, brown, grassless streaks on a lawn, created when moles tunnel below. These unsightly patches fall into two categories: primary and exploratory. Primary runways indicate active tunnels that you will want to bait.

doc-3: STEP 1: Locate Active Deep Tunnels. Unlike surface tunnels where you place bait on either side of an active assessment tunnel, you bait deep tunnels directly. To locate a deep tunnel, scrape the dirt away from the mound and locate the tunnel opening or hole, which leads down to the mole's active tunnel.

doc-1: Since moles are somewhat solitary animals there's typically only one mole using the active tunnel. If you trap a mole, move your trap to a new tunnel rather than setting it back in the same spot. If you don't trap a mole within 48 hours, move the trap to a new location.

doc-2: Setting The Tomcat Mole Trap. The Tomcat trap is a scissor trap which means the trap uses two scissor mechanisms that close on the mole when activated. For the trap to work correctly, the scissors must be set across an active mole tunnel.

doc-3: As the mole travels through the tunnel it activates the trigger which closes the trap, killing the mole. To set the trap, find an active mole tunnel and make a small depression on top of the tunnel about an inch deep with your heal. The trap has a depth gauge on the backside to check the correct depth. Next, align the trap over the depression and mark the width of the traps jaws.

doc-1: In contrast, the Trapline mole trap is a very small trap that slides into an intact mole run, and it is triggered directly by the mole as the mole passes through its tunnels. The jaws of the trap close directly onto the mole without having to close through a dirt blockage. This mechanism gives the Trapline mole trap a number of very important advantages over these other traps:

doc-2: Just ask anyone who has had the misfortune to trip over a mole run and sprain an ankle. Moles are active year round, 24/7, though they tend to be most active in the spring and fall. Generally, moles will create surface tunnels or ridges in the top 6 to 12 inches of the ground as this contains the largest food supply.

doc-3: The burrow is active if the flattened runway is raised again or the roof has been repaired within 48 hours. After identifying active burrows, carefully punch a hole in the top of the tunnels with pointed end of cone. Next, drop in a teaspoon of poison peanuts and carefully close the tunnel with sod or stone.

doc-3: 4. Set a trap. You'll need to buy a trap designed specifically for moles. There are two types of traps to choose from: a harpoon trap and a scissors trap. In either case, the mole will run inside and immediately be killed. Set a harpoon trap by making a well over an active tunnel.

    *Query*: What are the considerations for trapping a mole?
    *Documents*:

doc-1: 5. Check the trap. Once you've set your trap, you'll need to check it every day to see if you have caught a mole. If you do not find a mole in 4 to 5 days, you might have set the trap in a tunnel that is no longer in use. You'll need to move the trap to a different location.

doc-2: 2. Press down on an active mole tunnel with your thumb. Making a depression in the dirt will collapse the tunnel. This will require the mole to burrow through the obstructing dirt the next time it uses the tunnel, which will engage your trap.

doc-3: Live Traps. Live traps are one of the most humane ways to eradicate moles, as you are able to relocate the moles somewhere else (as opposed to killing them). This requires you to determine which tunnels are active and lay the traps.

In order to do it, go to the main screen of the game (where it shows the legendary and tells you to press start) and press Up, Select, and B at the same time.

doc-2: Metroid: Other M manual. ""If you press and hold [d-pad]* in the direction of the wall and press [2] with good timing, you'll kick your way up the wall. Note: You don't have to change the direction you're pressing on [d-pad]*."".

doc-3: The clock starts as soon as you gain control of your character, so long as there's no saved game on the cart. To erase all data, press UP, SELECT, and B at the title screen. Since the beginning dialog doesn't count to the overall time, you can name your character whatever you want without effect to your time.

doc-4: Pokemon. What level does Zubat evolve? Asked by Wiki User. See Answer. Top Answer. Wiki User. Answered 2014-04-04 19:15:23. Zubat evolves into Golbat starting at level 16, and then Golbat evolves into Crobat when leveled up with high friendship. Zubat is #41 in the National Pokedex, and was introduced in the Generation I Pokemon titles (Red, Blue, and Yellow) where it could be found at Mount Moon, in the Rock Tunnel, at the Seafom Islands, and on Victory Road.

doc-2: Press the X and B button, as well as the Up button on the d-pad, all at once. Once you do this, the game will ask if you wish to delete your save file, because it’s super permanent. Select Yes, and it’ll be wiped.

doc-3: If you wish to start the game over completely from scratch, you’ll have to delete your previous save data. This isn’t as straightforward as it sounds. When you boot up the game, the main menu only allows you to continue from your previously saved game. To delete your save data, boot up the game first. When the game’s intro movie is playing, hit the up button on the d-pad, and the X and B buttons at the same time as well.

doc-2: You'll then be asked whether you really want to delete all your data and so on. It might take a try or two, unless you have excellent timing when pressing buttons, but you'll get there. ---. That's it for how to restart your save file, but be sure to check out our other Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon guides for other tips and tricks to help you be a Pokemon Master!

Now just open up your character select screen (hold the character select button - Y on an Xbox Pad, Triangle on PS4) and Starfire should now be on there. You'll have to pay studs to unlock her though - it's 150,000, which isn't too bad, and is certainly worth it. Congratulations, you have now unlocked Starfire in LEGO DC Super Villains!

doc-2: By contrast, a reward compensates a single service to be performed only once, such as in the capture of a fugitive. Therefore, it will be earned solely by the person who succeeds in this regard. In practice, bounty hunters usually track down criminal defendants who skip bail and fail to appear for court appointments.

doc-2: Becoming Wanted. Normally, a bounty is issued by a government official or by the Marines. The idea is to tempt others into aiding the capture of the criminal so they can be brought to justice quickly. Bounty Hunters make careers trying to find and capture these wanted people.

doc-3: Bounty hunters answered the call, tracking the bad guys relentlessly for a piece of the reward money. They did anything it took to bring in the outlaws, ""dead or alive."". Today, the stereotype of the rogue bounty hunter remains, even though most modern bounty hunters are trained and licensed professionals.

doc-1: Other estimates for average pay are much lower, and it’s highly dependent on location. Some states don’t allow for professional bounty hunting. There is no such thing as a yearly bounty hunter salary. Rather, bounty hunter pay is based on a percentage of the bond for each fugitive caught.

doc-2: According to BountyHunterEdu.org_,_ this usually amounts to between 10 to 20 percent of a bond. In addition, years of experience don’t quite dictate bounty hunter pay either, since it’s all about success rate and negotiations rather than getting annual raises over time.

doc-1: If you’ve never heard of a professional bounty hunter, that’s because that title is not exactly formal. Professionally, bounty hunters are called fugitive recovery agents or bail enforcement agents. These professionals essentially track down fugitives who’ve skipped out on paying their bail.

doc-2: They’ll also need to put up some collateral, like a house. According to the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents, bounty hunters step in if that person skips out on their bail (i.e. becomes a fugitive and doesn’t show up for their court hearing, thus breaking the terms of their bail bond).

doc-3: However, since that percentage is a minimum of 10-20 percent, bounty hunters have the ability to earn a lucrative salary if they have enough experience and expertise. However, the median average salary for private detectives and investigators, which encompasses fugitive recovery agent jobs, is $50,700 as of May 2017, meaning half earn more and half earn less.

doc-1: Job Description. The job of a bounty hunter is to find an individual who's skipped a court hearing, forfeited any posted bail and whose whereabouts are unknown to the authorities. They often perform surveillance to find a fugitive, make arrests and bring fugitives back to the proper authorities.

doc-2: Work. |. Careers. |. Law Enforcement Jobs. By David Searls. Bounty hunters are hired by bail enforcement agents to track down their criminal defendant clients who have been released from jail on bail but have neglected to show up for a judicial hearing. If these “bail jumpers” can’t be found and brought back by a stated date, the bondsman will lose the bond -- the money posted as a guarantee that the defendant will show.

doc-3: Background. Bounty hunters, also referred to as bail bond enforcers or fugitive recovery investigators, have been a part of U.S. law enforcement from the beginning. Your rights were formally addressed in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Taylor v. Taintor in 1872.

doc-2: Keep in mind, though, that these rates change depending on the experience and training of the Bounty Hunter and new Bounty Hunters often earn around $25,000 in their first year. There is potential, however, to earn much more with proper training and experience.

doc-1: A: A bounty hunter is a fugitive recovery agent who is required when a bail bondsman secures and then revokes a bail bond for a defendant. The revocation typically occurs upon the defendant’s failure to appear in court. This is when the bounty hunter gets to work for a certain percentage of the bail bond as the compensation for recovering the fugitive.

In July 2015, TMZ reported that fellow bounty hunter Charles Fisher had filed a lawsuit against Duane and Beth Chapman, alleging that they made him look like a thief and called him ""a corrupt bondsman"" during his appearance on Dog and Beth: On the Hunt.

doc-3: Hunting for Bounty. Bounty hunters are people who have the authority of bond agents to arrest delinquent clients and deliver them to the appropriate authorities. They are usually paid a percentage of the bond amount. But they get paid only if they apprehend and return the fugitives. It's no surprise that they're so motivated—and often effective—at getting defendants back to court.

doc-1: The purpose of bail is to allow people to continue to live their lives while under suspicion of a crime. The suspect needs to work, contribute to his community, care for his family, and generally function in society. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, but the precise amount of bail required depends on a variety of circumstances including the risk of flight associated with the suspect, the suspect’s criminal history, the nature of the crime, the severity of the crime, the danger the suspect might pose to the public, the suspect’s family relationships, who will assist the suspect in appearing in court, employment status, employment history, and other factors.

doc-2: Indirect costs are assigned to projects as a percentage of direct costs. Thus if a campus uses an indirect cost rate of 50 percent, and if $1,000 of direct cost is incurred on a project, the campus would assign an indirect cost of $500 (50 percent of $1,000) and invoice the project sponsor for $1,500. The indirect costs paid to the University by project sponsors in this fashion are referred to as ""indirect cost or overhead recovery"", and represent the recovery of costs incurred by the University to provide the facilities and operational support for the project.

    *Query*: how does a bounty hunter make money
    *Documents*:

doc-1: If the accused individual does not show up to their court date, the bail bondsman is allowed, by law or contractual agreement, to physically bring the defendant to the court in order to recover the money paid out under the bond—this practice is usually expedited through the inclusion of a bounty hunter.

doc-2: Since bounty hunters are illegal in every developed country outside of the US, they aren’t allowed to apprehend the fugitive if they flee the country. Bounty hunters only go after fugitives who have fled their court case after bail money has been acquired from a bail bonds agency.

doc-3: A bounty hunter is hired by a bail bondsman to locate and arrest a person who does not show to court as agreed in their bail bond agreement. Bounty hunters are sometimes referred to as bail recovery agents.

doc-2: A bounty hunter may spend anywhere from a few hours to weeks or months trying to locate the fugitive. A bounty hunter’s salary or rate for hire is usually 10% of the bail bond, but can be much higher if the person is known to be difficult to locate. Upon arrest, the bounty hunter returns the fugitive to the bail bondsman and/or court or jail.

doc-3: Is a bail bondsman the same as a bounty hunter? No, a bail bondsman hires the bounty hunter to locate and arrest the criminal/fugitive. It’s possible that a bail bonds business has its own bounty hunter on staff, but typically these two jobs function separately, but in close partnership.

doc-1: Bounty Hunters – Role of Bail Recovery Agents in Bail Bonds. Bounty hunters play a key role in the bail bonds industry. They assist bail bondsmen when someone jumps bail. It’s important to understand the power and limitations that bounty hunters have, how they differ from bail bondsmen, and what you can expect if a bounty hunter is looking to apprehend you.

doc-2: The bail bondsman’s goal is to never have to use a bounty hunter. The goal for bail bonds companies is to charge their 10% fee and see the individual show up in court. When a person doesn’t show to court, it creates a risk for the bondsman where they need to pay out the full bail bond. The bounty hunter charges the bail bondsman 10% to locate the fugitive. 9 out of 10 fugitives are located and arrested.

doc-1: Most bounty hunters in the United States are employed by bail bondsmen. The bounty hunter is usually paid about 10% of the total bail amount, but this commission can vary on an individual, case-by-case basis, usually depending upon the difficulty level of the assignment and the approach used to exonerate the bail bond.

doc-2: Samantha tells Mulder that the Bounty Hunter and the clones are actually aliens, and the Bounty Hunter will begin chasing her as soon as he has killed the remaining clones. Meanwhile, Scully heads to a hotel to hide from the Bounty Hunter. Returning to the lab, she finds four more clones, who claim to be the last.

doc-3: If the defendant fails to appear in court, the bond agent is allowed by law or contractual arrangement to bring the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court in order to recover the money paid out under the bond, usually through the use of a bounty hunter. ""Only the Philippines has a surety bail system similar in structure and function [as the US]."".

As soon as your bail bond agent is informed of your failure to appear, they can legally search for you and bring you to the authorities, even without a warrant. But, rest assured, in the meantime, the court will issue a warrant for your arrest.

doc-2: The individual or their family may be required to provide collateral that is held by the bail agent until all court ordered obligations are met.

doc-2: Payment for Revoked Bonds. If a bond is revoked, it may also be forfeited, particularly if the reason is failure to appear in court. Because the FTA charge is in addition to the original charge for which the bond was issued, federal law and most state laws require forfeiture of the bond payment. If conditions of the bail are broken for charges other than FTA, it’s up to the discretion of the court and/or jurisdiction where the crime was committed to determine whether the bond payment must be forfeited.

doc-1: Salary Information. Typically, bounty hunters earn salaries based on commission; for each apprehension, a bounty hunter may take anywhere from 10% to 20% of the bond paid for the individual's release. Skill, experience, and location contribute greatly to the amount of money a bail enforcement agent can make.

doc-2: The Surety will financially back up the public official and pay the state if it garnered proof that the financial damages are caused by the bonded public official’s misconduct. The official will then reimburse the Surety with the full amount paid out. The bond cost, which is the percentage of the bond amount (usually 1%-5%), varies from state to state and will be based on the role of the public official and the risks linked to it.

doc-3: 10 Percent surety bond – The surety is not a bail bond agent, but instead is an adult 21 and older willing to help the defendant – most often a relative or close friend. For a $100,000 bond, for example, the defendant or individual surety pays $10,000 in cash to the court. Much of the money is returned, similar to a cash bond, making a surety bond without the help of a bail bond company a more affordable way for a defendant to get out of jail.

A bail-bondsmen makes money when they front money to a prisoner that can’t afford to pay their bail fee. For example, if a prisoner’s bail is set at $5000, the bail bondsman can charge a percentage of the $5000.

    *Query*: how does a bounty hunter make money
    *Documents*:

doc-1: The bondsman hires a bounty hunter to track the jumper and recover his property, so to speak. The bail-bondsmen will then pay the bounty hunter for recovery of the property (this number is usually around 10 percent) in order to avoid losing their $5000 investment.

doc-2: Tips to Increase Your Salary as a Bounty Hunter. Location, Location, Location! The location factor is one of the largest of influences on a salary of a bounty hunter. The name of the game is catching people, and the more people in a city means more jobs or jumpers to catch. This also means the bail amount is raised because a person will be harder to track or the local government has more money to expel.

doc-3: In New York, a bail may be anywhere between $3500 to $25000 or more for a jailbird with a criminal history. If a bail is set at $50,000 and a bounty hunter has to catch the jumper, the bounty hunter will make $5000 assuming he/she is operating at ten percent.

doc-1: If the individual does not show up for their court date “jumps bail”, the bond is forfeited. A bail enforcement agent is then hired to track down and apprehend the subject. The fee is 10-20% of the total bonded amount. For Example: Let’s say the bail bond agent pays $40,000 for their client to make bail.

doc-2: Then, the person doesn’t show up for their court date. A Bounty Hunter “Bail Enforcement Agent is then called in to find the fugitive. Upon capture, the individual is brought back to jail. 10% or $4000 of the total bonded amount is earned.

doc-3: A bounty hunter, or fugitive recovery agent, is a person who apprehends fugitives in exchange for a monetary reward “bounty”. If a defendant fails to show up for a court appearance, he is then considered a fugitive. When this happens, the bail bond company will hire a bounty hunter to recover the fugitive. The term “Fugitive Recovery” Agent is preferred by those in the industry over the more derogatory “bounty hunter” because the term “bounty hunter” conjures up images of the old west with its “dead or alive posters” and rewards offered in exchange for the fugitive.

Other names include Bail Agent, Bail Enforcement Agent, Bail Officer, Fugitive Recovery Agent, Fugitive Recovery Officer, or Bail Fugitive Recovery Specialist.

doc-2: The last known salary survey found that the average bounty hunter makes approximately $36,000 a year. While that number has surely gone up since the survey was conducted in 1997 it’s not a lot considering the insurance, travel, and equipment costs needed to be a successful bounty hunter.

doc-3: The first, and most common, is finding people who skipped out on bail and return them to prison. Sometimes bail is more than a defendant can afford so they utilize a bail bond to get out. Bail bonds are provided by bondsman or bail agents. The defendant, a friend, or relative, pays the bondsman’s fee, which is usually 10-20% of the bail amount, and the agent issues a bond to the court for bail.

doc-3: So bounty hunters investigate the bail skipper and figure out where he or she may be hiding. When the bail skipper is located, they are then taken to court where the bail bondsman is released from the bond agreement and gets his or her money back. The bounty hunter is paid a percentage of the original bail bond amount.

doc-1: The bail bondsman charges a fee for putting up bail and is usually nonrefundable. The bail bonding agency is then responsible for ensuring that the person appears in court. If there is a failure to appear in court, the bail bondsman can hire a bounty hunter to track and apprehend a defendant.

doc-2: The date of forfeiture is determined by the court judge. Forfeited bonds are paid to the U.S. government. A bail agent experienced in bail bonds can provide additional information.These bonds are used when a person is accused of a federal crime.

doc-3: Hunters are paid $8.10 hourly and given monthly bonuses based on the size of the snakes they capture. Since then, and with a few weeks remaining in the program, bounty hunters have bagged 2,000 pounds worth of giant snakes. Burmese pythons weigh about 200 pounds each, so that's roughly 10 massive snakes. In the video above, one of the bounty hunters wrestles a massive snake into the box -- it's the largest python ever caught at 16-feet long.

The act of skip tracing is most often used by bail bondsmen, bounty hunters, repossession agents, private investigators, debt collectors, and even journalists.

doc-1: Skip Tracing and Bounty Hunting. The term skip tracing is most often used in the field of bail bonds and bounty hunting, and many bounty hunters and bail bondsmen use the services of skip tracers to help locate individuals who have failed to meet the conditions of their bond.

doc-2: Both bail bondsmen and bounty hunters use skip tracing to locate an individual who has skipped bail. Because the defendant who skips bail does not want to be found for fear of being sent to prison (referred to as an intentional skip, versus an unintentional skip, which involves a person who isn’t trying to avoid detection), the job of skip tracing in the bail bonds field can be quite challenging.

doc-3: Job Duties of Bounty Hunters in California. Bounty hunters have a basic duty to track down “skippers,” or those who have jumped bail for a crime and are on the run. Fugitive retrieval agents track down these criminals and return them to justice in the county where they were originally wanted.

doc-1: State law defines when the full bail amount must be paid. For example, bail is not paid if the person is returned to custody by law enforcement or by bail recovery staff (sometimes called “bounty hunters”) within 180 days of the court’s decision.

doc-2: Issues. Contingency Fees. In the costly realm of the courts, the contingent fee system acts as an equalizer. It allows access to justice for those without great means – and deters meritless lawsuits. A contingency fee is meant to help the common man retain access to the courts by making it easier to pay for legal services. In a typical contingency fee agreement, the plaintiff is only responsible for paying their attorney if they win the case, with the payment coming as a percentage of the winnings, usually around 30%.

doc-1: How to Become a Bounty Hunter. The process to become a bounty hunter varies from state to state; about half of all U.S. states require official licensure or registration. Even in states without licensure requirements, bounty hunters need to build experience before they can expect any success in the field.

doc-2: In total, 46 U.S. states maintain private bail and fugitive recovery permissions, enabling bounty hunters to operate in aid of the criminal justice system. About half of these states maintain licensure requirements for bounty hunters.

doc-3: What Does a Bounty Hunter Do? Bounty hunters perform many tasks, but under most circumstances, their primary goal remains the same: to capture fugitives who have skipped bail. Bounty hunters may conduct investigations, interview subjects, and perform surveillance to identify the whereabouts of a suspect.

doc-1: What does bounty mean? A bounty is a reward, especially one offered in an official way for the capture of someone or something. This sense of the word most often refers to the reward sought by bounty hunters for tracking down and capturing fugitive criminals (or, in older times, killing them). A more recent use of the word refers to the reward offered for identifying a software vulnerability in a company’s or organization’s system.

doc-2: Bail Enforcement Agent. A Bail Enforcement Agent (BEA) a/k/a Bounty Hunter is defined as an individual or entity who (for a fee) apprehends individuals who have failed to appear on bond or bail and surrenders them to the appropriate jail or to court.

doc-3: BOUNTY HUNTER. Name for a category of persons who are offered a promised gratuity in return for ""hunting"" down and capturing or killing a designated target, usually a person or animal. Bounty hunters can be defined broadly as a category of persons who track down someone or something for money.

doc-1: Courts have granted bounty hunters extensive powers for the purposes of returning fugitives to justice. These include the powers to pursue a fugitive into another state, to arrest him or her at any time, and to break into a fugitive's house in order to capture him or her.

doc-2: A bounty is a subsidy that is paid to a category of persons who have performed a public service. Bounty is the proper term to be applied when the services of several persons are sought, and each person who fulfills the offer is entitled to the promised compensation. By contrast, a reward compensates a single service to be performed only once, such as in the capture of a fugitive.

doc-3: Therefore, it will be earned solely by the person who succeeds in this regard. In practice, bounty hunters usually track down criminal defendants who skip bail and fail to appear for court appointments. Bail skipping is a constant in the American criminal justice system.

While the state has no official licensing requirements for bounty hunters, California did enact the “Bail Fugitive Recovery Persons Act” in 1999, and then a new, updated version of the act in 2013. The act, also called Penal Code 1299 (or PC 1299), serves to provide a framework and some guidelines for those in California who want to make their living as a bail fugitive recovery agent.

doc-2: California Bounty Hunter Guide: Requirements and Steps. With a population of over 39 million people, California is one of the states that allows the profession of bounty hunting (a.k.a., bail fugitive recovery) without licensing, but with some regulations for qualifications and training requirements. Bounty hunters in California are called “bail fugitive recovery agents” and they aim to catch fugitives who have skipped bail (or “skips”) and bring them back into the hands of law enforcement.

doc-3: Michigan Bounty Hunter Guide: Requirements and Steps. With a population of 9.9 million people, Michigan allows the practice of bounty hunting but does not require licensure. 1 Bounty hunters apprehend fugitives who have skipped bail. The state is relatively silent on laws that regulate bounty hunters or “skip tracers” as known in the state, but the profession is authorized by Michigan Legislature Act 175 of 1927.

Nearly 12 million people live in the state of Ohio and the state allows for the licensing of bail bond agents (a.k.a. bounty hunters). 1 Bounty hunters often work independently as agents for bail bondsmen to apprehend fugitives who have skipped bail. In Ohio, using the titles “bounty hunter” or “bail enforcement agent” is illegal and considered a first-degree misdemeanor.

doc-2: Finding Work. Becoming a surety bail bond agent is essentially starting a new business, and all new businesses need a plan to acquire clients and to succeed. Bounty hunters should strive to network and build relationships with more experienced agents in their city to start getting steady work.

doc-3: Pennsylvania allows the practice of bounty hunting in the apprehension of fugitives, but bounty hunters must be employed by a licensed professional bail bondsman. To learn more about the basic requirements and process for becoming a bounty hunter in Pennsylvania, read the guide below.

doc-1: Virginia Bounty Hunter Guide: Requirements and Steps. Bounty hunting is an integral part of Virginia’s private bail system. In Virginia, a state of 8.4 million people, bounty hunters are referred to as bail enforcement agents (although “bounty hunter” is a legal term in the state). 1 Bail enforcement agents are licensed by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services (the Department).

doc-2: How Rogue Bounty Hunters Can Track Your Location. flemingn/Shutterstock.com. The latest controversy was touched off by Joseph Cox over at Motherboard, who gave a bounty hunter $300 and a phone number. That bounty hunter managed to find the precise, current location of the cellular phone associated with that phone number, down to a few hundred meters.

doc-3: Bounty hunting began in the days when local police forces didn't have the manpower or resources to track and apprehend fugitives, so they posted wanted posters offering a reward for the capture and return of the fugitive to police custody. Individuals who are critical thinkers, problem solvers, excel under pressure and are competent in defensive tactics may find a career as a bounty hunter to be both exciting and rewarding.

When you begin receiving assignments from the connections you have made with bail bond agents, successfully locating and apprehending the fugitives you have been assigned to is crucial to ensuring you continue to receive new assignments from those same bail bond agents.

doc-3: A bounty hunter is a professional who works on behalf of bail bond agents to locate and apprehend fugitives who have missed a court date or failed to uphold their responsibilities under the bail bond contract in some other way. When a criminal defendant misses a court date, the judge issues a failure to appear and gives the bail bond agent a specific period of time to locate the defendant and bring them back to court.

doc-1: Because bounty hunters work independently on behalf of the bail bond agent and not as state or federal agents, fugitives are not protected by the same constitutional rights that protect them from being apprehended by the police. The rights of the bail bond agent to locate, arrest, detain and transport a fugitive are established through a private contract, and those rights are passed on to the bounty hunter by the bail bond agent.

doc-2: The average annual salary of a bounty hunter varies based on the total amount of bail for each fugitive and the number of fugitives they apprehend. Because bounty hunters are independent agents working on behalf of the bail bond agent, they are paid only when they successfully apprehend a wanted fugitive through a percentage of the overall bail amount.

doc-3: National average salary: $62,038 per year. Primary duties: A recovery agent finds and apprehends people who have failed to show in court, or they may help to recover stolen property. They are sometimes called bail enforcement agents or bounty hunters. Recovery agents work with law enforcement agencies to make arrests.

doc-2: Hunting for Bounty. Bounty hunters are people who have the authority of bond agents to arrest delinquent clients and deliver them to the appropriate authorities. They are usually paid a percentage of the bond amount. But they get paid only if they apprehend and return the fugitives. It's no surprise that they're so motivated—and often effective—at getting defendants back to court.

doc-1: A bounty hunter specializes in tracking down and detaining fugitives. They are legally authorized by the court, through a bail bond agent. Because the fugitive is in violation of court ruling, the bounty hunter may use extensive means to make the arrest. Recovery agents may have to break into the fugitives residence, and physical struggles are not uncommon.

doc-2: Hunting for court bounty is a high-intensity, high-risk job. Recovery agents often have a strong background in military or law enforcement, and carry the corresponding trade tools. It is not uncommon to encounter resistance from fugitives, which is why many bounty hunters wear kevlar.

doc-3: Regulation and Rules for Fugitive Recovery Agents. Governmental entities refrain from regulating the manner in which bounty hunters can operate since the court is also dependent on the return of a fugitive. In essence, bounty hunters are given liberty to use any means under the law to detain a subject.

Bail bond agents or bail bondsman must work with bounty hunters in the event of a defendant jumping bail. The relationship between the two parallels that of the law and order system.

doc-2: Court Bond Cost. Also known as probate bonds, these court bonds tend to be priced more aggressively than most other types of surety bonds, as rates typically range between just 0.5% to 1% of the bond amount. Percentages can be slightly higher for smaller bond amounts, or for extraordinary requirements. As a rule, the larger the bond amount being required by the court, the lower the available premium rates.

doc-2: Mr Chapman, 46, a former biker, ex-convict, born-again Christian and father of 12, had appealed for information about Luster on his website, dogthebountyhunter.com. His slogan is ""born on a mountain, raised in a cave, arresting fugitives is all I crave"" and he claims to have tracked down 6,000 people, mainly bail jumpers. The normal fee for a bounty hunter, or ""bail enforcement agent"" as they are officially called, is between 15% and 20% of the bail, which in Luster's case was $1m.

doc-3: Unfortunately, there are plenty of criminals who try to run all the time, and never show up in court. Bail bondsmen hire bounty hunters to find these criminals, and force them to show up to trial. In exchange for their service, the bounty hunter receives 10-15% of the total bail amount.

doc-1: Learn more... Bounty hunters, also known as fugitive recovery or bond enforcement agents, track down people who didn't show up in court in exchange for a percentage of the individual’s bail. While this can be a lucrative pursuit, it's also quite dangerous.

doc-2: Staff Answer. Support wikiHow by unlocking this staff-researched answer. Bounty hunters aren’t typically salaried—instead, they get paid a percentage of the bond per fugitive that they arrest. A bounty hunter who takes on many cases each year can make a decent income, e.g., upwards of $50,000 per year.

doc-3: Bail enforcement agents, also known as skip tracers or bounty hunters, track down and apprehend fugitives – either those who failed to appear in court after being released from prison on bail, or those who have disappeared in an attempt to avoid other obligations, such as credit card debt or child support. If you want to hire a bounty hunter to track down someone, take time to research your candidates thoroughly before you commit.

doc-2: Admitting your mistakes and knowing how it has affected other people are strengths. Being considerate of others may be a rare quality, but it is surely one that can be easily learned. Our minds can be trained and re-framed to think “Less of me, more of others.”. Consideration is simply thoughtfulness in action.
