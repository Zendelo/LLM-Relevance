Now that I have explained why it is more efficient for a plane to fly at a higher cruising altitude, what then limits a plane to fly higher than this normal cruising altitude? On a Boeing 777, the maximum service ceiling (altitude at which the maximum rate of climb is reduced to around 100 feet/min) or aircraft*s certification altitude is 43,100 feet.<|eot_id|>

        Document: While aircraft are suppose to stay clear of flying below the 1,000ft/500ft minimum safe altitude limit (except during takeoff/landing of course) there shouldn’t be any close calls if everyone is following the rules since drone pilots are suppose to fly under 400ft. But this app is helpful for me because I have seen police helicopters flying in my city at very low altitudes for whatever reason and I don’t want to cause any confusion like the one some New York drone pilots experienced.<|eot_id|>

In general, low wing aircrafts have an advantage over high wing aircrafts when it comes to safety. This is because the wings of a low wing aircraft will absorb much of the impact of an emergency landing, whereas in a high wing aircraft, the fuselage would be the first part of the plane to make contact with the ground.<|eot_id|>

The ""solution"" to this problem was to fly at low altitudes, minimizing the radarline-of-sight and reducing exposure time.<|eot_id|>

        Document: Radar. Reportedly, the B-2 has a radar cross-section (RCS) of about 0.1 m 2 (1.1 sq ft). The bomber does not always fly stealthily; when nearing air defenses pilots ""stealth up"" the B-2, a maneuver whose details are secret. The aircraft is stealthy, except briefly when the bomb bay opens.<|eot_id|>

        Document: Soviet and Afghan records definitively confirm only six losses: four Su-22s supersonic fighter-bombers, one Su-25 “flying tank ” piloted by future Russian vice president Alexander Rutskoy, and one An-26 cargo plane. The PAF lost a single F-16, apparently struck by a missile fired by its own wingman. The F-16 patrols reportedly deterred more extensive bombardment of refugee camps on Pakistani soil, and disrupted Soviet efforts to resupply isolated outposts.<|eot_id|>

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Document: Share to Twitter. Share to Email. © Jaimie Wilson. Birds usually fly relatively low. Most of the year, they stay under 500 feet. During migration, though, birds gain altitude, and many species fly at 2,000 to 5,000 feet or higher, using prevailing winds to assist them. A bird may begin migration at about 5,000 feet and slowly climb to 20,000 feet. Birds can fly higher as they become lighter.<|eot_id|>

        Document: This could actually be more plausible depending on the angle and altitude of the aircraft as it opened fire. It's a likely scenario if the aircraft strafed at a low altitude close to the target, and if it was firing at a hard metal target, such as an obsolete tank or armored vehicle.<|eot_id|>

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Document: The 80s-era bomber may need to cut low-altitude flying due to old age. By Kyle Mizokami. Dec 11, 2019. HistoricalGetty Images. The B-1B Lancer heavy bomber was originally built in the 1980s. The B-1B was built for low-level flight, flying beneath radars to bomb targets deep behind enemy lines. Wear and tear to the airframes from decades of flight means the Air Force may restrict the B-1s from flying low.<|eot_id|>

        Document: The U.S. Air Force may soon have to restrict one of its bombers from a key mission profile: flying low. The B-1B Lancer bomber fleet is growing old and the Air Force is considering restricting its ability to fly low, which is reportedly hard on the aircraft, in order to keep the big airplanes flying. The B-1B bomber was built during the 1980s as a heavy strategic bomber to fight a nuclear war.<|eot_id|>

If you're talking about early minecraft, Reddit user AdamG3691 gives his answer. …I remember waaaaaaay back when classic mode was the only mode, water and lava were map destroying forces of nature (they spread infinitely from a single block), sponges had a use (making a 7x7x7 area where water couldn't exist), and indev and survivaltest was still a twinkle in notch's eye, there was the unofficial minecraft client, there were mods made for it, but they were essentially just flyhacks and noclip (press F to activate fly mode, Q was up, E was down, holding shift activated noclip). (there was also a thing that allowed you to do mass block placement/erasing,like a really low powered ingame MCedit)<|eot_id|>

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Document: Most helicopter operations are done with slower speeds or low altitudes in mind anyway (otherwise you'd probably get an airplane to do it). Basically a helicopter will fly as low as they need to to get the job done while still keeping enough altitude to be able to autorotate safely if an engine fails. Sanket Shah.<|eot_id|>

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Document: They fly at these altitudes because of the following reasons—. Less chances of bad weather like turbulence and windshear at high altitudes. The density of air is very low and the atmosphere is thin, due to which, aircrafts experience less aerodynamic drag. Since, the aerodynamic drag is less, low thrust is needed to maintain the aircraft’s speed; thereby giving the maximum Fuel Economy.<|eot_id|>

        Document: But to sound the alarm at lower levels, the exposure has to be much longer. At 40 ppm, it takes 10 hours for a Kidde detector to go off (and it doesn’t measure below that concentration). Yet the World Health Organization’s guidelines for CO exposure recommend no more than one hour of exposure at concentrations as low as 26 ppm. In other words, low levels of CO coming from a ventless gas fireplace might fly under a detector’s radar entirely.<|eot_id|>

The 3,000 m is a middle-distance race but is often considered a long-distance race for high-school athletes. While sprinters run races only on the balls of the feet, runners in longer distances also use the heel.

        Document: Difference Between Firm & Regular Golf Club Shafts. Choose a stiffer shaft if you swing harder. Golf club shafts come in five flexes and both graphite and steel shafts use the same system for determining flex. Because golf shafts bend during a swing based on how fast your club speed is, the faster your swing, the stiffer the flex you need. Since you need to make sure the club face is square with the ball at impact, finding the right flex is critical to consistently hitting the ball well.<|eot_id|>

        Document: A sprinting spike has almost no heel and pushes the runner up on her toes for maximum liftoff, but a mid distance spike has more support, as the runner needs more over a longer distance. You’ll also find a fairly stiff forefoot in the spike plate that still has enough flex for heel landing. The spikes themselves – also called pins – are also different.<|eot_id|>

        Document: Generally speaking, the longer the event, the fewer spikes you’ll need. With a mid distance shoe then, you won’t see as many spikes as a sprinter, but you’ll still have more than a long distance shoe. Mid distance spikes are the most versatile of all the track spikes. If you are new to track and trying lots of different events, mid distance spikes are a good option as they work fairly well for events like jumping and sprinting.<|eot_id|>

        Document: If you are racing on an indoor track, there can be regulations on the length of spike you are allowed to wear in order to keep the track intact as it’s used; on average, one-eighth (⅛) inch spikes are the standard for indoor track. As you gain experience and fine tune the feel you prefer in your spikes, you can toy around with a variety of spike shapes from pyramid to needle spikes on the track, but always be sure to check the meet rules before changing out your spikes.<|eot_id|>

        Query: Can older adults gain strength by training once per week?
        Document: Gender And Sexuality | Anthropology | Chegg Tutors. Show Transcript. hi guys my name is Katherine I'm one of the tutors here at Chegg usually I tutor science and some English but today we are going to do a sociology lesson which does have a science basis and we are going to be talking about gender and sex so a lot of people think that gender and sex are two words for the same thing and in the way that we use them a lot in society that can be true but they actually mean two totally different things so first we're going to talk about sex sex is a biological thing if you run enough tests on a newborn baby you can know their sex so when somebody is female they have 46 chromosomes and the two sex chromosomes are both what's called X chromosomes and typically what happens is the chromosomes that you have determine the genitals that your body makes and the hormones that it produces - so if you're female and you're you are 46 xx you will produce a lot of hormones like estrogen and estradiol and progesterone and the genitals that you'll get will be things like the labia and the clitoris on the outside and the vagina and the fallopian tubes on the inside if you're male you also have 46 chromosomes but you have one X and one y sex chromosome so the hormones that your body will make are things like testosterone and DHT and the genitals that you get will be things like the penis scrotum and testes but if you are paying attention you heard that I said that's what usually happens there's a whole other group of people who are called intersex and they are people usually where there's been a mismatch between their internal and external genitals so there are four types of intersex people the first are people who are 46 XY if you are paying attention over here we said before that people who are 46 why are people who are female right but these people have a really enlarged clitoris and labia and what ends up happening is they fuse together and they make something that looks more like a penis if somebody is 46 X Y they may have some sort of they could have some sort of like in incomplete external genitalia it could be ambiguous or it could look just completely female and on the inside their testes might be malformed they might be perfectly typical or they could be completely absent but they're still XY the third type of intersex people are what's called true gonad all intersex these people could have XX in some parts of their body or X and X Y in others they could have all of one type throughout their body but what characterizes them and what like separates them from the other types of intersex people is that they have both testicle and I think ovarian tissue let me just double check yes ovarian an testicle - testicular tissue it's always good to make sure that you know that you're telling people the right thing especially when you're a tutor but anyways so the fourth type of intersex is complex or undetermined intersex individuals so these are people who don't have 46 XX or 46 XY they could be 45 X so they're just missing an X chromosome it could be X X X they could be X X Y um they cannot be just Y turns out you need at least one Y chromosome in order sorry at least one X chromosome in order to survive but other than that there they can be all sorts of different mixtures and these people don't have a mismatch between their internal and external genitals but they do have some sort of hormonal issues and that can lead to issues later with sexual development and so okay so this thus far that is sex that's completely biological if you run enough tests on a newborn baby you can find out if they're XX or XY take off your third diaper and you see what their genitals look like you can figure it out what somebody's sex is at birth gender on the other hand is way more complicated so before we talk about what gender is we're going to talk about what gender is not so gender is not just having certain genitals and we know that because if you were to get into a really bad accident tomorrow and you were to lose your genitals because it was so awful um you you might be you know very upset and rightly so but you would still be you if you had a penis um and then you lost it you wouldn't say oh crap now I'm a woman like that was the only reason I was male that the only reason I was a man you know that's not true so sexy oh sorry gender can't just be genitals we also know it's not just chromosomes because people don't really know what their chromosomes are you know there's the Shania Twain song and it doesn't go I feel like an xx individual you have to there's an inside feeling of like oh no it's it's more than just that because there's no way to base your identity on a piece of information that you don't have and because of these two things it's also not if you're not able to tell what gender somebody is with a scientific test so what gender is is a performance in the context of the culture that you live in and another way of saying that is that it's a social construct and a lot of people get kind of like tripped up with that they say that that almost makes it sound like it's not real like a social construct is just we made up and it is true that we like made it up enough that we created it as a society but that doesn't make it not real ah there are a lot of other social constructs let's see I am American and that comes with the whole slew of like different ideas about work and about family and about like what makes a life well-lived and I have my place within that American society it's a place that I've determined for myself and even if I don't have all of the words to express it it's an intrinsic part of me now what it means for me to be an American we also know that gender is incredibly complicated in the same way that I don't have all of the words to talk about how I am American I don't have all of the words to talk about how I am a woman um sidenote because I don't think I said this explicitly man and woman those are two examples of gender words rather than sex words and you know what those things are even if you don't know how to say it often ah so one of my favorite sexologists that means a doctor who studies sex who talks about that is a woman named dr. lindsey doe and she describes the way we think about gender and the way we talk about gender is a lot like the way that mapmakers thought and talked about the world in the 1500s we're super curious we want to know the answers but we just don't have enough tools right now to do all of the work so she says if you want to put it in her fantastic wording um myself down there sometimes we have the words but not a complete sense of a concept for example gender performance roles and script other times we have concepts but not the words to realize them gender is the complex sets of how an individual relates to and identifies with multiple or no gender categorizations and there are a lot of gender categorizations and that's what will mostly be talking about now is what some of those more common ones are but there are way more than we could ever discuss in this video some people think that there's one gender categorization for every person out there um and that if there are so many if it's just an individual thing why describe them at all those are incredibly interesting questions but they are for another day so we're going to present you with three individuals right here this first one this is an xx individual so we remember before that if you're xx you are female so this X oops this access individual says I feel like a woman and this makes sense in our brains right xx female female individuals are often women but then look at this person they're XY and they also say I feel like a woman too um and that doesn't quite match up in our brains because you know XY is male and male we often associate with men and finally we've got this person over here they're xx and they say they don't feel like a woman um they don't say that they feel like a man but they don't feel like a woman so it's not possible just based on that to say exactly what everybody's gender is in this picture but what we can say is that this lady over here and we'll call her la because she says she feels like a woman and she's got two X chromosomes and hopefully that's ok with this stick figure she's what's called cisgendered what that means so sis is a Latin prefix that means on the same side we kind of line up like I said before female with woman and male with man so the female part of her is on the same side as the woman in our chart that makes her cisgendered this person right here he well who shoot that was a mistake this person doesn't have any so I shouldn't have said he because they say they feel like a woman so I probably should have said she um and if this person feels like a woman and is if they go around saying I'm a woman but they have an X Y that makes them something that instead is called transgender one sec actually I made a tiny mistake here it's cisgender not cisgendered because it said it's a actually I don't know why but it's transgender not transgendered um so it's Oh cuz it's an adjective but anyhow um this person is transgender and this person over here we are not so sure because they could also be transgender they could be some other gender that we'll talk about in a minute they could have no gender at all but something that we do know is that this person is this gender and that both of these lovely folks over here or what is called gender queer basically that just means they are not cisgendered so what we'll talk about next is almost sorts of different genderqueer people so the person in the middle over here this woman she is transgender so there's a lot of different words for talking about people who are transgender so the first two we just talked about trans and sis so trans meaning on the opposite side sis meaning on the same side so if somebody is female and they are a woman or they're male and they're a man they are cisgendered but if they are female and they're a man or they're male and they're a woman then they're transgendered so these next four ones the MTF FTM MTM and ft are just different ways of talking about that idea so if somebody is MTF what that means if somebody is MTF that means that they are a male to female transgendered person this woman right here is a fantastic example of that they have an X chromosome and a Y meaning they're biologically male but at the same time they are a woman it's a little tricky because male to female sounds like they're changing their sex instead of<|eot_id|>

        Document: Because of this, dumbbell deadlifts are just as effective as barbell deadlifts. Barbells are easier to load with heavy weights, which makes them a little easier to use but, if you aren’t a weightlifter or powerlifter, that doesn’t really matter. The benefits of dumbbell deadlifts are all but identical to conventional deadlift benefits, so don’t think you are missing out by only using a pair of dumbbells.<|eot_id|>

        Document: This is the same thing as deadlifting 3 times in 2 weeks. To put it to context, you will deadlift 18 times in 3 months, as compared to 12 times if you only performed deadlifts once a week. For optimal results, deadlifting heavy 3 times every two weeks is often better and more lucrative than going heavy just once a week.<|eot_id|>

        Document: 5. Consider cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Having a chronic and unpredictable physical condition is exhausting in itself, and it can take a toll on your emotional health. CBT, which is a form of talk therapy, teaches you to change the way you think about fatigue — and changing your thinking can alter the way you feel and act. A study published in May 2017 in the journal Current Opinion in Rheumatology suggested that RA-related fatigue may often be due to causes outside the condition itself — and that the best ways to reduce fatigue might be cognitive, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as behavioral, such as getting exercise.<|eot_id|>

        Query: Can older adults gain strength by training once per week?
        Document: Strength Building Training Guidelines. For strength training, the advice on progressive overloading is a little different. For novice to intermediate athletes, train with loads corresponding to 60% to 70% of 1 RM, 8–12 repetitions per set. For advanced training, cycle training loads of 80% to 100% of 1 RM for 1–6 sets to maximize muscular strength. In these guidelines, based on those established by the American College of Sports Medicine, training is similar for novice to intermediate trainers who are developing basic strength and muscle. 11 ﻿.<|eot_id|>

        Document: Session 2: Lift light (2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps with 1 to 2 minutes of rest between sets) Session 3: Lift moderate (2 to 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps, 1 to 2 minutes of rest between sets) Bodyweight moves are done in higher rep ranges, since there’s no external weight. To reap the greatest rewards, you should strength train year-round, hitting all your major muscle groups once to three times a week (more often during the off-season when you’re not riding as much; less frequently when you’re riding lots).<|eot_id|>
